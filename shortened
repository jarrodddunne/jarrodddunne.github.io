Lee Owen) Subject: XDM, Xkernel, and olwm Lines: 33 Distribution: na Date: Fri, 30 Apr 1993 05:41:10 GMT   Greetings, We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays.  When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged.    Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the department chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm, and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server).   Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? How about obvious gimmes? And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?  Any ideas are greatly appreciated.  Greg Owen  { gowen@forte.cs.tufts.edu, gowen@jade.tufts.edu } Systems Programmer and TA, Tufts University Computer Science Dept.

Suppose your parents committed some crime before you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in jail for it. Would you really think that is fair? I know I wouldn't.  Well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while she was pregnant? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT (this recently happened to a close friend of my wife and mine)?  OFTEN, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on innocent people. Several times in the OT, this is pointed out, even saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person's sin for several generations. Even today, we see multi-generational (to coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal abuse just to name three.  So, God's definition of fair and ours differ.  Some points of perspective:  Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see Webster's first definition of inbred) thanks to Adam, it is arrogant and foolish for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in their shoes. I know myself pretty well, and I'm just not that good. Take God's word for it, neither are you. "There is no one righteous..."  More important, when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus, God promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self's sinful tendency. We can, of course, choose to ignore this help.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,  Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will simply start using longer moduli and still be safe.  What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.

How about an average ML pitcher?  I can't believe that Morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive impact on the Jays performance ...  I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit where credit is due.  It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris.  Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Viola.  Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the  other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly).  Yes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented  the team from collapsing in August.  Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series.  Those innings were probably helpful.  His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out" I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a  veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.  Well, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly, this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better the rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the team's credit.  Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done this in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed. Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.  Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical Morris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not responsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team just didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't earn him a victory.  BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more can he be embarrassed?  Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start anymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.  Greg  </doc>

Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs had blockaded, and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars. Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens in Jerusalem.  Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin, but that attack does not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to paint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about In 1983, however, Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain) interviewed a survivor, Mophammed Sammour, who testified that 116 out of a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after the massacre,' Sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the five clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a list of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through the names.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure was wrong.'

Date: 10 May 93 09:09:14 GMT Lines: 70  In article  Fil.Sapienza@med.umich.edu (Fil Sapienza) writes: I am interested in finding out why people become atheists after having believed in some god/God. In conversing with them on other groups, I've often sensed anger or hostility.   Though I don't mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile, it does seem to be one motivation for giving up faith.  Thus, some atheism might result from  broken-ness.  I'd like to field this one, if I may.  Although I am a believer in and follower of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  In fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply couldn't_ believe in the existence of God.  Anyway, when I look back upon the troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with God.  The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through most of the arguments for the non-existence of God.  But way back when, these would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe.  I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do mean stubborn.  Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time) would fail.  The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my  life as others would tell me how God would have me live it.  A good example of this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet.  I am not, nor have I ever been, "on fire for Chirst," and I don't think I ever want to be. Nevertheless, I am not "lukewarm" about my faith, so I don't really fit in with the mainstream either.  Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right, but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because all the other Christians think so to.  Quite naturally, this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own. Complete freedom.  Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called "people of God" are behaving like total twits.  I can easily understand why someone would go that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.  IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively- hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and "shut-up-and-do-what- you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and- you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet" courtesy of some of Christ's more overzealous followers.    A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a very good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had for one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world, Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help them.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the emporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of  their own moral view.  There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time to go into them right now.    Tom Ault </doc>

The plan I have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any compatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board.  I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?    Thanks.     </doc>

<doc id="20_newsgroups/alt.atheism/52909" url="" title="20_newsgroups/alt.atheism/52909"> From: mathew  Subject: Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument Summary: Includes a list of logical fallacies Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 10:52:14 GMT Distribution: world Lines: 632  Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Version: 1.4  Constructing a Logical Argument  Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It is raining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of "deny", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists a God" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because", since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or therefore".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar, or the Son of God."  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  God created you; therefore do your duty to God."  The phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A because B".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not start." -- This is an argument.  My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine." This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:  All insects have wings (premise) Woodlice are insects (premise) Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:  All fish live in the sea (premise) Dolphins are fish (premise) Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" for implication.  The symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion.  T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference A        B        A=>B  F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.  T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion false, the inference must be invalid.  T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid, the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white."  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as "poisoning the well".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise."  Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real."  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred."  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan."  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women."  The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation" and John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists."  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere."  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache."  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons."  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office."  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God."  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  Have you stopped beating your wife?"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  Where did you hide the money you stole?"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?" or Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  We should not speak ILL of our friends" and We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight."  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses."  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana."  A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?"  Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?"  Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because "that's the way it's always been."  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."  Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King."  Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous "you too" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  You're just being randomly abusive." So?  You've been abusive too."   </doc>

<doc id="20_newsgroups/soc.religion.christian/21328" url="" title="20_newsgroups/soc.religion.christian/21328"> From: maridai@comm.mot.com (Marida Ignacio) Subject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception? Date: 6 May 93 04:35:52 GMT Lines: 111  Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to  bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to  soc.religion.christian.  Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the "Annunciation" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28  And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _"Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - "the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women" - while you read on....  In the book, "First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title "The Conception of Saint Anne", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber "out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body"; she is "God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms."  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as "innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve".  At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.   Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From "Pocket Catholic Cathechism" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely. The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace, the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin): Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel) Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural) The Lord is with you (At those times, God would definitely want to be with those He has made _blessed_) Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart.   Marida P.S.  I do hope that others will continue more light and facts on this matter.  Thanks.) </doc>

First, the pleasant:  Spike Owen.  All through spring training, this guy was  looking like the second coming of Mike Gallego, but with even worse hitting. Now the guy is third in the major leagues in BA, and he's ranked pretty high in total hits and runs scored. I know it's still early in the season, but he and  Pat Kelly (more on him in a minute) have provided a lot of  spark at the bottom of the order that's given the big guys Mattingly, Tartabull, O'Neill) plenty of RBI opportunities. Let's hope he keeps this up.  Pat Kelly. The guy is finally showing some of the ability that led Stick Michael to label him a "star for the 90s". I wouldn't go that far, but Kelly looks infinitely improved at bat (I guess the tips he took from Boggs in spring training really paid off. Huh! And here I thought Boggs would never do anything to help anybody besides himself!). And his glove, like always, has been terrific (he and Mattingly comprise the best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball IMHO).  Paul O'Neill. We had to get rid of Roberto Kelly, partly  because he was under too much pressure in NY to be the next Barry Bonds (he won't do that in Cincy, either), and partly because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up in the second half of the year. I just felt that we could've gotten more for him than O'Neill. Well, so far, O'Neill is turning out just fine. He looks like he should be able to duplicate (if not surpass) Mel Hall's numbers from last year, and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around Tartabull. Now, if only Buck would play him against lefties some more to  see what he can do!  Wickman. A friend made a comparison between Wickman and Jack Morris - they never have impressive stats but they always find some way to win (although Morris seems to be losing that ability). I figured that Wickman would be the least important part of the Steve Sax trade (best trade since we got that Ruth guy), maybe winding up as a good middle reliever. But I like what I've seen so far. He doesn't pitch pretty, but he gets the job done.  Key. What's going on here? Key was just supposed to provide the rotation with some stability (you know, shore up the left side, provide experience, get maybe 15 wins), and here this guy is *dominating* everybody he faces! Who needs Maddux or Cone ? I'll take Key any day.  And now, the not so pleasant surprises:  Spike Owen. Sure, he's hitting like crazy, but the guy *cannot* field to save his life! And they said he was brought in to provide defense? Velarde, Stankiewicz, and even Silvestri are better defensively than Owen.  Remember - it's still early. Look for his offense to tail off, and his defense to improve (hopefully). He has that rep because I heard that either last year, or over the last 5 years, or something like that - he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops - behind C.R. and Tony (I'm not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all) Fernandez. I do agree though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.  Tartabull. The book on Tartabull was, keep him healthy and he'll produce. Well, he hasn't done too much so far. Sure. he's hit a few homers, but those were all solo shots, and he hasn't gotten any of the "big" RBIs that your cleanup man is supposed to give you. Then again, he had a slow start last year (once he got off the DL, that is) and turned into a one-man wrecking crew late in the year, so we'll see.  The Bullpen. UGH!!!!!What happened? We were supposed to have one of the most solid pens in the majors! Meanwhile, the pen has already blown three saves (maybe more - I haven't checked). The great Howe/Farr lefty/righty tandem? Farr's ERA is in the s or 30s, and Howe's is.....infinite. (I didn't think such a thing was possible, but it is). Hopefully, they'll get their acts together, or else Buck's gonna burn out the starters for fear that the bullpen'll blow a lead.  In the immortal words of the Scooter, "Holy Cow, Seaver! That Johnny Key guy can pitch, can't he?"  See you in the Series!  Alan </doc>

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: "is he the one who is to come or do we look for another". (see book of Matthew)   I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'  or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.   Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with  great power and glory.   My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ.  Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.  Mike </doc>

I think that naturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives or other "consumption".  It's only when the chemists concoct  an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they  really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything. How in the world do you suppose it's legal to "consume" tobacco products which probably SHOULD be banned)?  No, there is something called the "Delany Amendment" which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the s, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.  This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are banned.  This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good, and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned. This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.  If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect.  An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as "gumbo file'". This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This is not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural form, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption was made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats. </doc>

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate "Lezghistan" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  I have been drafted, but I won't go," said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. "Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia."  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  The police don't force people to go," he said. "They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan."  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders," said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians."  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine," complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  We want our own country," he said. "We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us."  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.

He was a madman who was going to hurt the children, and everyone else in the compound no matter what the FBI did.  The situation in Waco was similar to a hostage situation with a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person. In such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the hostage.  Janet Reno blindly stumbled in there and basically threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would release the hostage.  It's no surprise that the madman would pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation.  Such a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions with the result of the police trying to take the place by force and the result being the death of the hostages and the gunmen. However, this is the first time I've heard of the blame landing squarely on the police.

Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.  As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.  Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy.

The same liberals you are upset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcare people.

While your posts offend me I dont think it would be right for you to get fired over it.  I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative action laws of the 60's did. My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights have.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord finds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired. Do you REALLY think these are justified ?

Why is someone elses will such a big deal if morality is all relative.   I don't believe I ever said that morality was all relative.  What I said was that I can make my mind up on my own, thank you, and that  you don't have the right to tell others what to think.  I think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is  a respect for human life and the dignity of the person.  It is all the stuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between  primitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us.    hudson) Maybe (the insane lover of pain might reason) if other people experienced enough pain, they might learn to enjoy it, too.    Fine.  There is still the clinical definition of crazy.  And this also involves a violation of free will, because the insane lover of your little example would be inflicting pain on a non-willing subject.

That is a patently false statement.  hudson) You have to have some sort of premise about choice or self-awareness.   No, you do not.  I demonstrated to you the example of the football team which doesn't require premises about freedom of choice or  sentience/self-awareness.

The reason why people DO science is that they value it's results. That does not mean that science has it's basis in values. Any more than DES stops working if I stop valuing my privacy. It's partly as you say: the reason why people do science is that they value it's results. Right.  If one follows relativism to the letter, then, the theories and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively valued as 'objective', 'correct', or anything else. Twaddle. You're overloading the meaning of the word "value", that's all. Whether I care if the results are true is a "value". I fail to see how whether they are true (correct, whatever) is a value.  The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it, if you care to look at it that way - however your perception of a result's truth cannot match its actual truth, unless you care to follow the  procedure to obtain truth ("science") correctly.  You have to pick  the right procedure, and note its importance.  You've got to value it. Otherwise you don't care about actual truth, and shouldn't object to the statement "objectivism is true".  Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure, science cannot be valued non-subjectively.   If we're picking facts and hypotheses subjectively, then we are using a maybe-not-quite-sure method on maybe-not-quite-sure observations.  That should lead to maybe-not-quite-sure results, no?  The fact that it does not seem to might make one question the premise, which is that our subjective valuations are necessarily unreliable.  No, wait - I've a better idea:  "And the result's actual truth is..."? Yeah, that's the ticket.  Like I said before, DES works whether I value my privacy or not.  O.K., which DES?  The abstract function DES? that stops working in any  important sense if no-one cares for the importance of truth, mathematics,  meaning, information, etc.  A DES chip or DES s/w?  That stops working in any  important sense if no-one values science, objective reality, etc.   DES does not work in a value vacuum.  Nothing else does, either.

You have learned that they intend to  charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological  warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up and will receive a fair trial.

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.

The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.

We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)

Source: Pierre Oberling, "The Road to Bellapais: The Turkish Cypriot Exodus to Northern Cyprus", Social Science Monographs, Boulder, ISBN 88033-000-7.  Well, according to a book by C.M.Woodhouse I've read it looks like the situation was much more complicated than either of us suggest. Needless to say nationalism on both the Greek and Turkish side was strong and began in April of '74 with confrontations over the Agean (as usual) between the government in Turkey and the Ioannidis junta. In July 15 an assasination attempt against Makarios (then president of Cyprus) plotted by Ioannidis, ruling dictator in Greece, fails and Makarios flees to England. The journalist Nicos Sampson takes over in a coup led by the Greek officers in the Cyprus National Guard. Turkish forces which had been mobilized in anticipation begin landing on the north shore of the island on 20th of July. This caused the welcomed collapse of the dictatorship the 24th with Mr. Karamanlis returning from  Well, I am forced to disagree with you. The Greeks started massacring  the Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into  Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is  nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention  was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing  numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been  planned for a peaceful minority.  The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots  will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain  eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the  cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was  the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops  on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of  Archibishop Makarios.  The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.  Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If  such assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason  to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate  their past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find  it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before,  for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical  vicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation of two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another  armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily  but decisively terminated by the Turks.   The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population  in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which  were established through international treaties. One might be better advised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve  Greece well.  An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions  that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for  Greece or her friends.

Again, application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of gay Christians is largeely specious.  Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world).  what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse   at all.  Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing the elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those who were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension, God); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:  Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament, refer to idolatry, while "flesh" (as in I Pet 1:24)  denotes human society and its violent attempts at self- exaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to their followers." [p. 199]   There is no inherent reason to read this verse  as literally referring to actual sexual lust for "alien flesh".  Nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin of homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and not merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 "This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, bit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.

This, it seems, is the crux of your whole position, isn't it?  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal. Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, "Well, we sold him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad for Kuwait."  No, unfortunately, sitting back and "letting things be" is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein's military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to Hussein.  But it's STILL HAPPENING.  That's the entire point.  Only last month, John Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.  The same month, we sold jet fighters to the same Indonesian government that's busy killing the East Timorese.  It's all very well to say "Oops, we made a boo-boo, better clean up the mistake", but the US and UK *keep* making the *same* mistake.  They do it so often that I can't believe it's not deliberate.  This suspicion is reinforced by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit economy reliant on arms sales.  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor so much, it was the U.S.'s and the West's shortsightedness in selling arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?

(follow-up) Date: 15 Apr 93 05:02:13 GMT Lines: 53 Return-Path:   I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.  In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C. Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent "ex-gay" ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as "ineffective . . . not one person was healed."  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed "reparative therapy."  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June called "The Ex-Ex-Gay" by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is "physically" forced to stay in this "reparative therapy" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.  For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.

The trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what you should do instead.

(Of course the cause of the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the Ozone Depletion Problem.)  Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozone-depleting  chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree' measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions:  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C. Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.  Steel may not melt at 1000C, but it will weaken, expand and deform. If there is enough of a load on the steel, like the load on a steel roof truss, or the pressure exerted by steel parts in a machine trying to expand against each other, the steel can and will deform extensively. For the record, any weapon found in the cult compound should be indentifiable, but it may be impossible to do normal ballistics tests because of the  damage done to the weapon.  If, if, if....

Date: 29 Apr 1993 05:50:41 GMT Lines: 302  In article  Center for Policy Research  writes:  By Elias Davidsson - April 1991 (Revision Oct. 1991)  Note - you are already posting "facts", some of which are outdated.  The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a "meeting of the minds".  It is to those who read with open mind, that I address myself.  The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial discrimination as "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life."  While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals, as the text currently stands I know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found. It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation.  The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.  If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.  Scarey thought.  The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native non-Jews born in that country.   Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not alienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent.  This slant permeates the text.  Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.  The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups. Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].  Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).  If I recall correctly, at the time "zionism" took off, there was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any factual contradictory evidence .  But the Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000 non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.  Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on "most of their villages"?  Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their political repression and their destitution.  There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was that this was not the case.  You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this.  As you do again, below.  In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.  Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions, though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them. Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.  Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of international law and UN resolutions.  Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship, what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country previously (other than Iraq) ?  It must be emphasized that, although these people live under different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).  Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an "ethnic or racial" basis.  Therefore your above statement is incorrect.  I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination, the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically. However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period!  Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that represents them in world affairs.  Once again, some do, some don't.  The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.  Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you espouse.  licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be challenged in court.  Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal. Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some are, but this is not due to the "whims" of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization.  Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied territories are permitted to carry firearms.  Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in Daheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.  Jewish settlers have right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish settlement.  That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this.  Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in practice.  Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in, right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but as a result of what actions?  Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied residence and membership rights in most rural communities in Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos; Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian children are denied the right to learn their history and literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the authorities.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members. It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish collective.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case  in point.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material.  You have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank. It is based upon Jordan's school system.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another gross generalization.    The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of  ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.  Another generalization, but lets not stop here. The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't, Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items, I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered previously.  Although sexual relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal, they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.  When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true, nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.  Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has not produced any written Constitution.   Simply incorrect. The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your contentions to the sidelines.  Zionism predicates a state where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law, a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.  But the discrimination is not based upon race. Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.  Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel - that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed to fail.  Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail. Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate shall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the amount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.

The ruling in Cohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest law firm representing the women athletes. This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of opportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams," said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case. The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions receiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as university-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for uniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members. This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights," said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney & Labinger.  "Universities across America need to reevaluate their programs quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced." Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania , and Colgate University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity teams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is representing women athletes at IUP. In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included: Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The National Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and National Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in support of TLPJ's appeal.  </doc>

Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed to concern the Oiler's future.  Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference, Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.  Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier, but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.  As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if the team does move, there is no place more deserving than Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of Bettman?

Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not constitute what the Apostle Paul called "becoming all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some."

I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously you aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.  Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:  Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts.  Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane') Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one person.  A mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience. In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and OOBEs as does in waking life.  Like , but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe  different) moral laws apply there.  So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know of another alternative?  respond by post or email.  thanks very much  dt*     </doc>

The media 'are'.  'Media' means 'more than one medium.'  There are thousands of publications.  Some say this, some say that.    How can the bulk of the people be informed, when they won't read informative publications?  Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative publications.  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand. Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, with the usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: media in this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, and such publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).  And they all say pretty much the same thing.  I see most of them being in the range of center-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-sky we-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave.  There seems to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpret events in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not good at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information about them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be clarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper had I not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET, let alone Internet access?  For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging. Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not have TIME to go digging, and many are not  aware things are wrong, so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that is the way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren't TOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the problem.  And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political connections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if any rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their polticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt, peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nasty when someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors, etc tend to fall into those with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the current state of affairs.  The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi for daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the law he pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a less well-connected person would have been crucified.  A typical example of one standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.  Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solution sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is going on, or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position where one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite of a journalist in DC described above.  One notices that these less-than complimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the media.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views on the subject, and it involved a 'brother' journalist.

In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast  network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents.  Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in  Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and  fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula.  They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in  an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.'

In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis.

An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious  Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged  by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no   witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All  they had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed  near the  building, and the press could've done their job, and would've  been able to back the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no  risk to the press.  Unless they did not want the public to see something.   The complete lack of any  other source of information other than the  FBI really causes me concern.   Sick to my stomach, and getting sicker from all the Government apologists  Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it.  What's going on here?  Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next. I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse.  IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations. They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles, obstensibly to perform "gas insertions" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push him over the edge.  Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning) claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the gas insertion" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.  Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.  The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back, abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls are.  Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).  Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right in the end.  But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily concede that "ridiculous reasons" can play an important role in how scientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.  Gary H.

How do you know they can be shortened by half-an-hour?  Has anybody done a study to determine how much time is actually "wasted" -- say, in these A's games?  Oh, probably.  Ms. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for and 1992.  (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows? She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)  Those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*.  Something is being done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games by 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches.  Given the increasing specialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me.  If it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  Then I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules, which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).  The problem is, who decides whether that time is "wasted?"  You don't seem to think it is at all.  Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows?  If the rules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my mind.  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing, or else nothing will be changed.

This is exactly what it has become -- a far cry from its original position of stature .  Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times "Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period"; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that "the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia" was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, "provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by "following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a "small fishing village" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had "opulent and flourishing bazaars" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware." During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: "other major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah."  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, "Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy."  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a "major city")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.    Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.  In the early 1980's Tyre had over 22,000 people.  So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000. Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards we are talking about a one-horse town.  A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says "Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000."   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.     After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200's, I believe.  What other times did it fall that you were thinking of?   To Egypt (250 bce); to the Seleucids (198 bce); Rome (63 bce); after Rome it fell to various Arab contingents until 1124 ce when it was captured in the Crusades;  it was then recaptured again by the Muslims in 1291 ce and subsequently pillaged; then the French, Turks, British, and today, Lebanon.  I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?  Well, it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye Tyrian purple" in Roman times.   This is correct, but they were under Roman domination, and the  majority of the created wealth was siphoned off.  The prophesy hold true.  They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre "receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ..."  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.  Who is Josh McDowell.  A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I've read; I'm curious to know why.)  dj </doc>

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.  In article , rchui@nswc-wo.nswc.navy.mil (Raymond Chui) writes: Hello, the real reality. Our agency started to express interest in virtual reality.  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we know about are the Hollywood movies "The Terminater 2" and "Lawnmover Man".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and Computer Graphics World magazine.   Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).    We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading companies, agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4, HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?   It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization , requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing  shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.   What kind of graphics languages are used with VR GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?  You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster, being targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most popular are (in no particular order):  Division Inc.		    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS Sens8 Inc.

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts,  on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good  service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point,  but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.

His definition is tied directly to that of the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.  What you call "the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it" is precisely the result of the first Christians getting together and trying to find an acceptable answer to your question "what is a Christian?". I can't see what you are objecting to: someone is saying what historians of all beliefs would agree on, and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot?  You really ought to say what you mean by "belief in Jesus Christ". It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a Christian. Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God. But followers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that Jesus was the incarnation of God - along with large numbers of other historical and mythical figures.  So perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it is to be a Christian, as handed down by the Universal Church, you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a Christian.

Why the Peace Run  ----  There's a new spirit in the Nineties: a spirit of oneness, a growing belief in the possibility of true global peace.  The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into a reality in their own lives.  Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand - join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe. Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying the message of brotherhood to all humankind.  Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.   Making History  ----  The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break- throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian- Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace; and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.   Speaking as One: World  ---- Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----  The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over - Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and entertainment personalities.  Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including specials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.  I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace and reconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to live amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human family, God's family."  - Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize Winner   How It All Works  ----  Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New York City on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to lead up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag Hammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the world were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.  From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered: miles.  The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear about the event."  - Carl Lewis, Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist   Who's Behind It  ----  The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, an international running organization that believes sports can be a powerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Team puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.  The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace, offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless world figures to advance the cause of international harmony.  The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit organization based in the United States.   Take a Step For Peace  ----  The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a million participants. We're expecting even more people to join Peace Run '93.  You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps, a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the runners as they carry the Torch through your community.  You can also join local celebrities and government officials in one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the nation route.  Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.

Unfortunately, it also wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the high byte of the address is hardwired to 1).  The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the and 6526), and 1 8 bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I think this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so many games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do something else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.  There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at least 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I imagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly to chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so the 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly normal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more usual active low chip select.

What God did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw.    Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest "imperfection" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting "theological arguments" like this.  Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.  I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)   Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   Actually, neither of us "knows" what the atmosphere was like at the time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace "created" with "formed", since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed "degeneration"?   I can understand Scott's reaction:  Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what  Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!    In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you. You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you cannot *know* that.  I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  Human DNA, being more "complex", tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.  But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing "evil" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.  You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.  Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I never said that people are "meant" (presumably by God) "to be punished by getting diseases".  Why I did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?  Oh, I admit it's not perfect .  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a "why behind"? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?  Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment.  I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

If they can sell you or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent of its light, they make more _money_.  Never mind that your money is wasted.  It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware. If that's what your city will buy, that's what the lighting company will sell. Write a letter to city hall.  That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia  recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.   Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs.

If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth, and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.  Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage, the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to "defend the faith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.  So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually do - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one but Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.  I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.

There seems to be a lot of complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One article contained a comment that the owner called the factory and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4").  That figure (1/4") for image rotation would seem to be a little high... on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12").  Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right side doesn't help matters.  What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment?   I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are adjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my case quite :).  Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?  I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC, finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO, but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

[ note: not a clean way to die back in those  days ], etc.   All would be considered cruel under your definition. All were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers.

Data is data, and it could be anywhere on the drive.  Can SCSI find it faster?  can it get it off the drive and into the computer faster?  Does it have a better cache system?  I thought SCSI was good at managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached.  If we are only talking about a single drive, explain why SCSI is inherently faster at managing data from a hard drive.  IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized  drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?  Who said ISA was necessary?  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth investing thousands of dollars (e.g. a new pc's worth of money ) in .  Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone know how they perform?  You didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism as standard IDE.  If transfer rate is limited by IDE, whether it's interfaced to ISA, EISA or VLB matters not.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. As implimented on what system?    On mine, for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water, hands down.  If IDE has better throughput, why isn't it used on workstations and file servers?    The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.    Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence? What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?  No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to come down in price.  No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list: You can add many different types of devices and access them  concurrently. A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go) SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the termination, plug it in, and away it goes. I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.  I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.  </doc>

Date: 19 Apr 93 09:14:36 GMT Lines: 182  Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler    Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend "to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies."  It adds that "not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command."Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: "We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy."    Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled Penalties for Specific Offenses" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with "Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of "Penalties for Specific Offenses" which is entitled "Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: "A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See."  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:  The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the Church.    It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February Remnant merits careful study:  In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist "obstinancies." And from the eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has "an erroneous concept of Tradition." If this were so, Cardinal Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987: Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern and shares it." </doc>

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.  This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive answer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material.  On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).  This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.  There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it.  Paul F.

The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem. Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can. Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.

The previous method led to problems on some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunched into the upper left corner).  Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup.  The PostScript driver should do a better job of producing EPSF'able output.  A few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):  Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with the xvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson. The problem here is how to include support for this in the user interface.  Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freely distributable routines for this.  Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presently the only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF into FrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.  Add support for HDF/NetCDF. I'm interested in your opinion on how one would write a generic reader for these file formats.

Friday local Tel Aviv's paper, affiliated with Maariv.  Date: 19 February 1993  Journalist: Guy Ehrlich  Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories.  Excerpts from the article:  A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane".  A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness.  A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.  Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off something.  Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know what to say.  But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly.  We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts."  Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there."  Transl. by Israel Shahak.  </doc>

You refer to differing interpretations of "create," and say that many Christians may not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.  I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word "create" is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.   Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent, you say "granted the Mormon belief..." You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant.  I should have said "given the Mormon belief."  If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point.  The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms.  The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:  It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being "offspring" of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually "born again" of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For  We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, you have to look at the Bible.  On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply "look at the Bible" to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures?  I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his "I have my own conclusions" to addressing the point.  Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)   Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may certainly be.  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons.

However, I believe that the cursor will be under the server's control (could be wrong)?  On an Xterminal, for example, if the server was NOT the one controlling the cursor, then trying to get the xterm application to do the blinking would cause needless and yucky network overhead (consistantly).    Most people who write cursor blinking code just implement the simple case: a straight 500msec (or so) on/off cycle.  However, the cursor will work much better if cursor blinking is suppressed (i.e. the cursor is made visible) any time the cursor moves and for .5 to 1 sec thereafter.  If you don't do this, the cursor will be hard to track when in motion.  You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking, set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough advertising.  I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10).  The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you  do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped.  As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.  As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else  than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today.

True, there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but the internal power supply is well-protected. (I've turned my Mac on and off  six or seven times a day for three years without problem).  The monitor is the same.  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much as a television, possibly more.  Turn it off when you're not using it.  It'll save you money and the world a few more resources.  The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to the power surge at start up.  It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it cools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles of this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal cycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the phosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :")   Charles Kuehmann Northwestern University Steel Research Group </doc>

That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)

Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:  How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all phones with wiretap chips? How much would it cost to make each chip? How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip? What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed law enforcement blocks"? What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?  Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?

If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors.  Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration, you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they can be.  Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government. You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying "this is good because it gives people privacy", note that we didn't need them to give us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware right now.  Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been for them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.  They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands.

I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on the open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots like the guys that bombed the trade center.

Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.   The document below is the result of that effort.   Dorothy Denning   THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY  Dorothy Denning  April 19, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is Mbits a second.  Each chip includes the following components:  the Skipjack encryption algorithm F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N, a 30-bit serial number U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:  E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and  E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mikotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a bit block R1:  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:    R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]  R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.  The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.  The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.   ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.   The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.   I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck. I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.   For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.  So far so good!   Edward Hui   </doc>

Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  If the languages we sepak are the result of Babel, then it stands to reason that angels would speak a different language from us.  You do  have a valid point about multiple angelic languages.  But angelic beings maybe of different species so to speak.  maybe different species communicate differently.    I don't know either.  Truth be known, so little is known of angels to even guess.  All we really know is that angels ALWAYS speak in the nativ tongue of the person they're talking to, so perhaps they don't have ANY language of their own.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.  I have heard an eyewitness account, myself.  Such things are hard to prove. They don't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well.  I don';t know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway.  Well, we are told to test the spirits.  While you could do this scripturally, to see if someones claims are backed by the bible, I see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy Lazarus really was dead and now he's alive.  Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their "victories" (since most ailments "cured" are just plain unprovable) and modern day ressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.  That's an unprovable statement.  How can you prove if somethings been proved? There is no way to know that you've seen all the evidence.  Once I  saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer.    It's a common fallacy you commit.  The non-falsifiability trick.  How can I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen?  Answer:  I can't.  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove  anything.    When I say it has never been proven, I'm talking about the ones making the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving.  The burden of proof rest with the claimant.  Unfortunately,  pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end pontification).  But truthfully, Corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just so poorly translated into English) that much remains unknown about just what Paul really intended (despite claims of hard proof one way or another).  Some will see his writings in cor 12-14 as saying don't do this don't do this and using sarcasm, metaphor, etc. while yet others take what he says literally sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding.  Me?  When I read 1 Cor 14 about praying/speaking in tongues regarding building oneself/the church, I see him using compare/contrast, saying do this because it build the church, while doing this builds onself (implying don't do that).  It's a common usage of writing that we all employ, and it is easily seen how it COULD be interpreted this way.  Why some do and some don't is a mystery. </doc>

Not wether you believe in Jesus, but if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way better than others.  Perhaps I would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were glorifying God rather than themselves. Then perhaps we'd witness a real miracle.  Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know. But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are faked.  In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He said that "I do nothing, except what my father tells me." Perhaps it woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that example!

Many theists believe that there is "no proof of the existence of God" but choose to believe in him anyway.  I haven't yet found an argument for atheism that can't quickly be broken down to unprovable assumptions.  This isn't a problem with me (everybody needs to have a faith) but if you believe that you can provide a "purely  logical" argument for the nonexistence of God, I'd really like to see it.  Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question "Does God exist?" i.e. self-awareness and reason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?  You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since we can only use faith, why is one picture of "God" (e.g. Hinduism) any less valid than another (e.g. Christianity)?  Ahh...but when you use science and reason, you have faith in certain beliefs of the scientific method--for example:  The physical laws of the universe are stable. Our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth. Objective reality exists. Logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions.  Can you prove any of these?

Most/many/some (pick one) corporations have an attitude that the NSA is part of our government and "we support our government", as one very famous CEO put it to me one day.  It's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give. It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of money behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it too. The same good old greed.

Think *very* carefully. Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want to trade elsewhere.  Despite the fact that they answer the phone, "Hi! I'm  and we're having a GREAT Day!", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.  The details:  I ordered one of their house brand "Infotel" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems. In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not have ordered it, had I known this in advance.  It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.  For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.  Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested disabling the COM2 port.  This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem.  I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail  hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I  was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they  didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.  I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number. She promptly switched me to a "Tech Support" rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.  Conclusion:  I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more  than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.  For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know  will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have known better...  </doc>

Buehler) writes:  Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that's  one primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism  produces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any  volitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby's soul  gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have  without Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his  intellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the  child gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.   I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried  out!  When you think "your army" is stronger than "mine", you would  righteously" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is  really "best" for them. You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the  context of the teachings of Jesus/God.  I think he advocated a different  approach that was *by design* made to be appealing, to those called by him,  not chosen by a church practice. It seems to me you have the cause and effect switched, the change comes  and then you get baptized.

Clemens hasn't.   What *does* it take to play on a WS winning club?  We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin- ing "best" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of "best" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  The fact is that Morris didn't "win" any ballgames, Toronto did, in spite of Morris' "contribution".   This has been explained to you  Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.  many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.  You don't have to be rude.  You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.  For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.

Generally the ship sinks (sorry, there's a picture of the USS Iowa next to my desk).  Bullets go flying every where. IMHO, these "gunshot wounds" were actually caused when the magazines  went up.  First, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of penetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter.  Unless that expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice "pop" and not enough threat for even firefighters to worry about.  Finally, it's rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to a crisp.  See, by the time the ammunition went up those people were quite dead.  Look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising.  However, it's my contention that it makes little difference whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the Feds seem to have shared responsibility for both.      </doc>

The person informing me called it 'Nicereal Meningicocis' . In retrospect, the disease struck her probably sometime on  Friday evening and she passed away about 2:30pm on Saturday. The symptoms seemed to be a rash that started small and then began progressing rapidly. She began turning blue eventually which was the tip-off that this was serious but by that time it was too late (this is all second hand info.).  My question is: Is this an unusual form of Menangitis?  How is it transmitted? How does it work (ie. how does it kill so quickly)?  There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the "meningococcus", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis is a huge topic, and sci.med can't do it justice.   km </doc>

You then followed it with:  This episode is an example of a good government running amok with newly acquired power.    Really?

But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged "quotations" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir Yassin "massacre."  You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology. At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding quotations" that support your preset opinions.  If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your "quotations" have an axe to grind, and therefore you must be very careful about whom you "quote."  For example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar, and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy quotation" that you can use to attack Israel.  Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a "scholar" when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled. It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence, you will see his "indictment" to be pure hot air.  And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as scholarly," he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.  The Deir Yassin "massacre" never took place as the propagandists tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila "massacres." Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for "massacres," even if they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews like to do it, for reasons of their own.  Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin "massacre" stuff with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version unless you find something serious to contradict it.  Vic </doc>

Hedonistic sexual behavior is  condemned in the Bible and no act of true reason will make it any less condemned.  Hatred, murder, gossip; all these are condemned.

In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to  do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we  present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.  Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing. Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say Crucify him" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were "invited" to sit during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian "invitation",  I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lord's presence.  So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware  of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should  just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in Catholic Masses lately?  John Murray </doc>

The second question is, "What makes Gerry think that the Davidians' actions would have been different had another type of warrant been in use ?"  I'd like to see both of these questions answered before seeking judgment as to any claims about my IQ.   No, a no-knock warrant is in clear violation of the 4th amendment. Okay, what about the fact that they were tipped off - they shouldn't have opened fire - right?  WRONG!  Think about this: I am a drug dealer and my competition wants to do away with me. They call me and tell me that the Feds are on their way with a no-knock warrant. So, being moronic sheep we wait, with our guns holstered. Now, instead of the Feds, in comes my competition, and we're history.  The only acceptable answer to a no-knock warrant is blazing guns!  I may sound paranoid, but our government is out of control, and killing a few federal officers make knock some sense back into it.  A spurious analogy, especially for one so skeptical as Gerry.

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9  inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up. This will eventually cause death.  Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable improvement in their condition.

Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.    From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving  a fixed intermediate frequency  that is more easily amplified. The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer.

The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.

Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as  Bill much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it or not, it's there.x </doc>

Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:  a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading) e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1 f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS, EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within acceptable range j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY  As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU) Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU) Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process. In the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in the sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command process.

If I can succeed, can I re-tighten it not too tight, is it safe without oil leak?  You shouldn't need any power tools to undo it, an electric drill probably won't give you much extra torque anyway.  WD40 will help things that are seized due to rust but this is unlikely for a drain plug.  You should be able to undo it with a spanner.  When it loosens, it will probably become very loose and you will bash your knuckles on the underside of the car - this is the price you must pay for doing you own work.  No, that's the price you pay for not knowing how to use a wrench.  You want to pull the wrench towards you, away from painful knuckle splitting hard things.  If you can't pull it because things are in the way, push it with an open hand.  I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face.  After coming to, which is about 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain.

I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done, since they had not been born yet.  Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born."   Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the man born blind (John 9) was not.  There is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them, do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.  And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist, who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to  have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But  it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether  he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in  the first case and very weak in the third.  I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed  in this newsgroup in particular.  I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes  important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our  understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the  significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I  have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible  to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.

The narrower view that a hacker, when associated with the computing environment, is a dishonest expert is not so widespread, I'm my opinion, at least with the people involved with the field. IMHO the wider meaning is not obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to be!  [....]  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]  Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.  I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider themselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10". This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:  hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.  The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net (see {network, the} and Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see hacker ethic, the}).  It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.  hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.  Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that all* information should be free and *any* proprietary control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU} project.  Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to  break into a system, and then  explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.  The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address}) can function without central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)  Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.  No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way. Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)  Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place, then language is working.   include  ================///=============| AMIGA: The computer for the creative mind"  Commodore /// Weber State  | Macintosh: The computer for the rest of us" Apple \\\///   University  | I think, therefore I AMiga" -- val@csulx.weber.edu ==\///= Ogden UT USA =| </doc>

If they do charge you, and you are found innocent, they have to buy you a new phone.    Yes, but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to go back and use the phone with the new key instead of the phone whose key they obtained?  It is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks messages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. The announcement was silent on this. The betting seems to be that once your key has been obtained (by the authorities, by divorce lawyers, by the Mafia, by the FBI, by lost or stolen backup tapes, by the NSA, etc.). all previous conversations are unsecure. (Session keys are negotiated, but knowing the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the security. No doubt more details will emerge.)  So, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lot more than merely replacing the phone.  Sort of like saying to someone, "Oh, I copied your diary. But I'll buy you a new one."   And the system, if made mandatory (as I expect), will make such storing of conversations much easier, I fear. For one thing, the transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone listening, a kind of "Caller ID" and "Callee ID" on a grand scale. Also, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the privacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be useless encrypted junk.

Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just Members of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers.  In the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats, which increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five years, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next elections are due in 1994.  Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one country to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just used its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections. British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per district; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional representation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to be a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands).  The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its own members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to comply with, regardless of the Member State he wants to be elected for. I would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions:  Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every Member State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that is)?  Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or more MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional representation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per district?).  Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be directly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or by the joint Member State governments as it is now?  The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for election in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you?  Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament or a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government body?  The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels. MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to the status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament should meet in one city only, and if yes, which?  Please post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are automatically directed. If you do not have access to that group, please mail your answer directly to me and I will post it for you.  I hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter.

Date: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 17:01:51 GMT Lines: 208  In  guncer@enuxha.eas.asu.edu (Selim Guncer ) writes:  You might not like what Bernard Lewis writes about, label him as a Zionist or such to discredit him etc.   You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book Orientalism" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim.  I think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in "Race and Slavery in the Middle East", since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under Islam, and the practice of slavery in other countries, like the US prior to the civil war. He also does not conceal that there are verses in the Quran which promote the liberation of slaves. What he doesn't, and I don't think nobody can, deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be abolished in Islamic countries. Now you might, rather conveniently, blame the practice of slavery on Muslims, but the facts are out there. I also fail to see the relevance of the claim of Lewis being a "Zionist" to what I wrote.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read "Orientalism" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).  They were encyclopaedic information which anybody can access - that slavery was abolished at certain dates some 1200 years after Muhammed, that this was the cause of tensions in the Ottoman empire between the Arab slave traders and the government etc.. We also have in the ASU library volumes of British documents on slavery where reports and documents concerning slavery all around the world can be found, which I checked some of the incidents Lewis mentions. So I don't think ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence.  I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read "Orientalism" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for yourself_.  The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES, when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex. I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines, I wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc., which is contrary to the notion that "sex is for procreation only". In other words, such claims are baseless in the Quran and the Hadith.  If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.  I seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you. Islam is not "advocating" slavery. Slavery was an existing institution in the  th century. It advised on slaves being freed for good deeds etc., which is nothing new. Many cultures saw this as a good thing. What is the problem here? But I can argue rightfully that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses politically - the Quran rewards the good slave, so obey your master and perhaps one day you'll be free.  But, it is very understandable that I do not communicate with Muslims, since they assume the Quran is from a "God", and I think it is a rule-based system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo. Slaves are a part of this system, the subordination of women so that their function in society boils down to child-making is a part of this system, etc.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title "Islam and Women", reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says "I am a Muslim" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?  It is very natural to think that the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of  the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial  revolution.  Well, rules have changed and the status quo has driven  Muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a "heathen" world.  Muslim countries have failed economically, they were unable to  accumulate any wealth - directly due to the uncomprimising economic rules in the Quran. In fact, the rise of Islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home, but increase your wealth by conquering places.    You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)  When this stopped, you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour. No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health statistics are miserable etc..   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.  You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims  for following the Quran.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not.  Your idea is baseless from historical facts, it is a poor utopia,   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by "following the Qur'an" that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.   while my ideas are derived from social and economic history.   You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.  My solution to all Muslims is simple: CUT THE CRAP,   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.  GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT   Here too.  AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.  Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.

Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people  come out with their hands up several weeks ago.  It didn't happen.  And who is responsible for it not happening? Certainly not the children.  Koresh was calling the shots.  He was  talking with his lawyer and the FBI.  Since others were released safely,  there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound.  scenario that is simplest and most plausible.  I do not generally  believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely  scenarios.  The FBI sent letters to Martin Luther King's wife insinuating that MLK was having an affair!  Again, please tell us exactly how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government.  More than someone who would not release children from the compound.  Obviously.  You are an authority worshiper.  Not at all.  Are you a Koresh worshiper?  I.e., more than David Koresh/Vernon Howell/"Jesus Christ".

Give me a camera, and time with you, and I can present excerpts that show you   to be a cult leader.  Guarenteed.   Thanks for my laugh of the day!  Definitely a very silly supposition.  You should at least view the whole   documentary before you claim it as a source.  I would if I could.  The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also  had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically  confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the  compound in 1992.  I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair.  I think they  bungled it badly from the start.  But I don't think they are  responsible for the fire, which started in two different places.  Two places, eh?  You saw this?  Or did the wonderful FBI tell you this?   I saw one place.  I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site. A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two  story window shown on the tv coverage.  The BATF is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair. But to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is  ludicrous.  I suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to risk small arms fire to get some good footage.  These people were told to get the hell out of camera range.  Why?  Couldn't answer this one, eh?  This is the most important question of all, it   is the root cause of all the other suspicion.  I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press  in Grenada and how that set the precedent, but decided it wasn't worthy  of discussion.  If the news reporter got shot, you can bet his family  would sue the government for letting him into the danger area.  The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee  a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took  to burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was  first introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior.     </doc>

But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.  The most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry, the penalty is only a fine.  If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the lex talionis* doctrine of "an eye for an eye" applies.  This is the Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on these verses. This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the word "miscarriage" to mean "premature birth"--i.e., the child is born alive--and "further injury" to mean injury to either the woman or the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.  What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am truly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is  little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is not surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little reference to nuclear power and contamination.  While your interpretation is a reasonable one, I see no reason to reject the other out of hand.  The King Jimmy translation says "if there is no further mischief."  This does not necessarily imply to the woman.  I know if my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort, we would feel that a life was truly taken, not simply a process halted. </doc>

However, using the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right place and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court.   Question : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of view, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police also, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write > ). The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things. If an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data carried by a person rather than sending it electronically.  The clipper chip will not change this.   The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own police following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have its own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international traffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there be an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?  Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase in the next years.  I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the risk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ? I think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done not only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can help reducing these.

It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these non-linearities are "Gamma-corrected" before encoding NTSC signals or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.  Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC monitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry correct for "gamma errrors"?  Your response is much appreciated.  Amjad.

Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch.  The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory.  On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation.   The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY  s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at  hostname`:1.0  Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line. My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB  Bitmap Stuff Sucked. Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. Xmail was very usable.  At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged "WINDOWS should not be called a SCHEDULER", besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while.  Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales person said they performed about the same, given the over head of WINDOWS I question this?  many thanks for help to all who responded  gerard </doc>

There is only one way of determin- ing "best" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  And you know what?  There is no such method inherent in real life either.  So I would assume you would endorse the notion that we  cannot state, with any level of objectivity, that Mother Theresa has accomplished more good in this world than Joseph Stalin. After all, life on earth is a team effort.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of "best" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  Have you tried glasses?  I find them quite useful.    After all, there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present.  It's too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge; you live a poorer life as a result of that choice.  Heck, I'd wager that you could predict a WS winner with greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  And you know why?  Because I have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary, you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level.     You don't have to be rude.  Have you tried calling a kettle black?  For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  In other words, in your world, you cannot objectively state that Jack Morris was more important to the Blue Jays than Al Leiter last year.  In your world, that may indeed be true.  Fortunately, in the world the rest of us occupy, it's not.  I hope you never serve on a jury, Roger.  I think the rest of the jury would have to kill you.  "There's no way I can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty.  You see, there are billion other people on this planet.  We have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn't for all the other people on the planet.  We have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet, because living on this planet is a team effort.  And no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society; he is a part of that society.  That being case, anything I have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity, so I refuse to vote."  Greg   </doc>

Be careful here...the problem isn't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich rich.  But the "values and systems that make the rich rich" all basically amount to freedom of choice.   In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family farm.   Farm economy households were economically diversified, producing not only agricultural goods but also "manufactured" goods, especially  cloth.  Many farm women carded, spun, and/or wove, producing not only cloth for their own family but also to sell, generating extra income.  But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England and by the 1820's it had moved to the US, in both cases in the form  of textile mills.  These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently and cheaply than people at home.    The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to  go to work in these same mills in Lowell, Mass, or Nashua, NH, where they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening, dangerous conditions, living  regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis- eases due to the work.  Now people didn't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth.  They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support their local economy . . .   Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system and make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit.  but (sorry for the cliche), "it takes two to tango".   The big rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff. It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also  its social center.  You KNEW the merchants you did business with  or even local kids working behind the counter.   You would see people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat.  Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop  at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of thousands or millions.  You have no particular relationship with the companies you do business with, and feel no particular commitment to them, nor they to you.   Major components of what defines a "com- munity" have been destroyed.   On the other hand the products we buy at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign manufacture, and they are probably of better, or at least more consistent, quality.   I have to constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make money.  Money doesn't make us happy; it just prevents certain things making us more unhappy.  Therefore, don't shoot the rich.  Shoot the conservatives!  Don't blame the conservatives for this.  Everyone makes their own individual choice and the liberals and the fence-sitters are just as guilty of pretending there are no social and cultural consequences to economic choices.   peter  </doc>

The first part of the plan is to begin a  comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues  such as export controls which have effectively denied most people  easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues  posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has  already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before  any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the  Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone  equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed  by the National Security Agency. The so-called "Clipper Chip" is an  bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into  chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow  agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over  law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The  encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be  available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their  communications products.  This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution  before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may  not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may  have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the  government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets  based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested.  Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm  classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public  and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a  standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed  system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and  law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored  publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the  safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive  individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal  inquiries?    In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the  importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into  digital privacy and security.  However, the "Clipper chip" solution  ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before  the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of  whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid  warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts  over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General  will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the  Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal  agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental  organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents  yet.  Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the  communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person  using it.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back door means by  which the government or others could break the code without  securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will  be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order  to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for  an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security  arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results  of the investigation would then be made public.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government  believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big  customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service,  VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.   FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director Daniel J.

SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.    This a "tried and true" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups: to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the opposing "state" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or, in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?  If Israel insists that the so called "Security Zone" is necessary for the protection of  Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.    Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of "demilitarized" or "buffer" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.  If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.    What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some "guaratees"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their "word"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards "anti-Israel guerillas in-residence".  I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled.  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and Somehow, with that "limitation" on the troops "powers" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) "guarantees" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a "ruse"?).  This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in.    Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that "many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate." If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.  If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the so-called "Security Zone" before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.  From Israel's perspective, "concessions" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given "something" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to "take back" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.  Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by "private groups", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest "trust" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such  circumstances,   Ah, ok...what is "different" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague "political factors" but about those "tangible" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that "guarantee" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of "difference" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.  and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon.  Basil  It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.  Tim  Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one-sided and selectively naive. </doc>

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)   I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  Free options The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86 is listed below.  X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com). It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4, X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more). X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  Commercial options  Metro Link W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  What is XFree86?  XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:  The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86, selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2. The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately faster than X386 1.2. Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients, or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4 with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported. Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets. Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about the ATI and Trident drivers. Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu). Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu. New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions. Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux. A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA cards is now included.  The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2 they were not in XFree86 1.1):  The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200  see the X386 manual page for more information). Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux). SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1. Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for more information.) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some  versions of these devices were not previously compatible). A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation). Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many  vendor servers (see the X386keybd manual page for more  information). The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server. Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386  manual page for more information on the format of this file).  Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file in the source distribution for full details.  Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  What OSs are supported?  XFree86 supports: SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2 SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2 Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1  BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey .  Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, but anyone should feel free to submit patches. If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  What video hardware is supported?  At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:  Tseng ET4000 Tseng ET3000 Paradise PVGA1 Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of the PVGA1, and use its driver) Genoa GVGA Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 ATI 18800, 28800  All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in color mode.  The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.  It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with future XFree86 releases.  If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details. In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.  Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 working fine on them.  What about accelerated boards?  At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).  An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact for 386BSD or  for Linux.  A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact  or . Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?  The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame- buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure). But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this, but nothing is yet available from the project.  What other hardware or software requirements are there?  Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable  lower bound.  Where can I get source for XFree86?  Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from: export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)  Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  Where can I get binaries for XFree86?  Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from: ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries under /XFree86/SVR4 ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3  binaries under /pub/ISC ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3  binaries under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries under /pub/linux/packages/X11 agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries under /i386  Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will contain a README file that describes what files you need to take from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  Installation directories  The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.  This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  Configuration files  The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup. The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes  David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to David for inclusion in the database.  If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file  with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.  NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up starting the server in the future.  Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit  If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?  First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  SVR4 Why won't my xterm run properly?  If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run. csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'  The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  SVR3  Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  BSD  Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.  Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey The latest version should be available in the file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:  agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  Linux  You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc jump libraries installed.  Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.  If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the pn argument to X386.  Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but startx won't.  When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".  For more detailed information, please read the file README present with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  Mach  Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?  This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  BSD compatibility library  A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  ANSICCOPTIONS  This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see something like CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings" and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi" CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is: ANSICCOPTIONS= to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.  XFree86 Contact Information  Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86 Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:  The original "gang of four": David Dawes  Glenn Lai  Jim Tsillas  David Wexelblat   Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems: Robert Baron  [Mach] Rich Murphey  [386BSD] Orest Zborowski  [Linux]  e-mail sent to  will reach all of the core team.

Now, I would like to delete one of the rectangles. The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes. A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel  locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is  something that should be avoided.  You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  Clear the bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor.  Draw the one that is to stay with GXclear.  Then GXxor the entire pixmap with the screen.    Note that this is a pretty effective way of animation, if you ever need to do that (replace the GXclear with a GXxor).

I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue. Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination, grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity.  At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness. He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years. After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.  Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.

It looked to me like they were practicing to shoot someone...  The point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this area (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  This is not to say that people in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.   There isn't necessarily a conflict between practicing with a concealed weapon for self-defence and practicing to shoot someone. Armed self-defence does occasionally involve shooting an attacker.  Frank Crary CU Boulder  I agree.      If you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you most likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.

"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive."  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire," Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his year-old elder brother.  I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat," he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We have never got any of the bodies back."  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.

Does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they're called Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?  Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.  Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage "hot" turbine to final stage "cold" turbine).

Atheists argue for abortion, defend homosexuality as a means of population control, insist that the only values are biological and condemn war and capital punishment. According to Benedikt, if something is contardictory, it cannot exist, which in this case means atheists I suppose. I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an excellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital punishment, I'm sorry but the logic escapes me.  First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as  capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.    If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I  presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together.  As for the issues, let's start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact. However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless of what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That's my opinion, and I am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.  I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I  certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.    As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and  population control.

Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade  MAGI:   Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant "member of the tribe," as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish ("hostile to a member of the tribe"). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to "member of the priestly tribe" and perhaps to "priest" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the "Magoi" as one of the six tribes of the Medes. For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi. The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis. There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, "gift"), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the "mixture" of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as "chorus," from the root mangh, which is said to mean "sing the magic song" (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for "priest," athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  Gershevitch, 1964). The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati ("head of the Magi"). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad ("the high priest of high priests") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia. The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or "Ahrimanical," animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white. In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the "magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes" and thus the "cult of the gods." Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself. During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration. No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like "goes," "expert in the magic arts" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge. To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts. The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name. Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, "the law-abjuring daivas"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange. The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu ("beneficent spirit") and Angra Mainyu ("hostile spirit") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.] Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.] The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.  SAOSHYANT: The Avestan term saoshyant ("future benefactor"; MPers., soshans) designates the savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind. The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro- astrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas. Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao- shyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present state of the world, when existence will be "rehabilitated" and "made splendid." See Frashokereti] Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors are born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in Lake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran), protected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited Saoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta ("he who embodies truth"), the son of the Vispataurvairi ("she who conquers all"), is the third, who will make existence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted unlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will be immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and of asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil, which will be destroyed. The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, "he who makes truth grow," and Ukhshyatnemah, "he who makes reverence grow"; the names of the three virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally speculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind. The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid period (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining factor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the confines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha, Maitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source. </doc>

Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War, Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)  The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs.  While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to  attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war.  One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud, and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt...  It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The  Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.  Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.  We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief, Odishelidge. They were as follows:  The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless  Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood  near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.  The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one. Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.  During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the  Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the  Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing.  Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot.  Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:  There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads. Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140  centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.  A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be  proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers, the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.  An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:  The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men  of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were  released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.  Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered on the streets.  On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk.   When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would  be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the  Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same  day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. However no result was achieved.  In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the  Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.  The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.   I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority. Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians. You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers."

The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word "value" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as objective values."  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word "values" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?

It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series.   Pre-game comments  Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary  This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed "Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty."  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... "NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs."   Rating  Nothing too special in this episode.  I'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.

No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won.   I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Roy stood on his  head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed  Hextall for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall  the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there  are any legitimate excuses.   Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces  description of lucky bounces.....] Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...   I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result  in a goal.   but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.  In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second  goal.  This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.  What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the  game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy* goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.  Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please.   WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times.  Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5  For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.  The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans.  I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.    dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca   </doc>

If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a "goat" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.    Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.    In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue, and personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.

For example, is there a constant sensation of falling?   Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied: Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first, but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that of sky diving.  I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll tell you about my first flight.  At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold).  At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay attention to physiology at that time.  After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don't get sick on the thing.)  I didn't think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" so much as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.  Jerry: And what is the motion sickness that some astronauts occasionally experience?   Ron: It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is "above" the head of the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to see how to keep the number of occurances down.  I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do, among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual aids.  The goal was to measure the victim's^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject's responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness symptoms.  Jerry --  I don't know of any former or active-duty astronauts who personally read this group.

The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.    First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give  succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of  you typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean  it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of  individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.    Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like "What would convince you of the existence of God" imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens. In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my use of "God" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier  than just repeating "a deity or higher power" every time.    Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system" although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  required to get the precise idea across.    Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.      Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum  Theism  Agnosticism  Weak Atheism  Strong Atheism?   Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.     In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe  in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume  that the answer to this is "yes;" if you've always been an atheist, or at least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)   How serious was your/your family's involvement?    How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?    How and when did your "final break" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I  realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an "event" per se; whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.     What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your "conversion" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?     Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?     To what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you  feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as  an explanatory method?    What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the  plausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time?    Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new "secular religion," and that "scientists are, in a very real sense, the new priesthood."  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base, or even a religious element?)      This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your beliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.      Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what I'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what I've asked about above.

And why were there no fire-engines within a mile of the compound?  Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that has a range of 3000 meters.  They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells.  Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides, the ranch house (not "fort apocalypse"; it was just a house despite what the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The "Gun loonies" couldn't hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames. The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well* under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't even tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that the FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve. Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.  Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American people will probably believe them.  Next question.   The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.  This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On the other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound. But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons hasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke any laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified. The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol violations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.  The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.  Sounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are "heavily-armed religious wackos".  David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out peacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON THEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.  It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity  to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead he ordered the murder of the children.  Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions of committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this. Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the Waco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.  In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the  suicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the  AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes they were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons.  You're wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They had MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.  The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of  magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch  apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than 80.  Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the  question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.   Can you think of a better way of getting the children out?  A 100% certain way?   The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for  them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require them to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through.  Gun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.  This greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well.  This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.  Still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in  resolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a  comparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular the person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF agents and 17 children on his or her conscience.   There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO may not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage.  The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation.  this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.

All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air.

Pls. explain. If almost all people agree that the sun exists (in the usual, uncritical sense), and almost all people agree that  a deal is bad,  it's a reasonable  conclusion that the sun really does exist, and that the deal really is bad. I disagree completely. Until rather recently, most people did not believe in evolution or the possibility of the atom bomb. Popular opinion is notoriously wrong about matters of fact. True, but nevertheless the basis of all "matters of fact" is overwhelming popular opinion, and some overwhelming popular opinion *is* fact ("the sun shines").  If it were not so, physics would be a personal matter, assumed to be different for each of us.  There would be YourGravity and MyGravity and no theoretical framework to encompass them and predict both.   This is simply complete nonsense. The basis for 'matters of fact' is, if any class of opinion, the majority of INFORMED popular opinion for some value of informed. I would really hate to base my knowledge of, for instance, QM on what the overwhelming popular opinion is.  The *basis*, Eric, is people peering at the world and saying what they see.  I'm talking about uninterpreted facts - observations.  _People_ do those.  Agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory that is more than personal.  about *raw* observations ("the dial reads 1.2") matter, in other words, though  they can surely be mistaken (or even lying) there too ("I saw the statue  move!").  Getting to theories from raw facts is certainly error-prone, but one assumes that the raw facts are usually as reported, otherwise science is impossible.   Opinions about 'raw facts' as you call them are somewhat different than interpretations of those raw facts.  I know this.  You know this.  Can we proceed?  Now I take an experience of good/evil to be every bit as raw a fact as an experience of pain, or vision. That might seem like a good first pass guess, but it turns out to be a pretty cruddy way to look at things, because we all seem to have rather different opinions (experiences) about what is good and evil, while we seem to be able to agree on what the meter says.  You're not comparing apples with apples.  If we all look at the same meter, we'll agree.  If we're all in the same situation, that's when we'll agree on fundamental values, if at all.  People who say that nobody agrees on values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either.  For me, an ethical standard can be nothing more than a hypothesis about the modification of observed value through human actions ("It will be better if..." == "You ought"). See above. We can't seem to agree on what's better.  See above.  We sometimes can.  There is also the matter of inertia against experimentation.  Most, if not all, moral hypotheses are necessarily tested by way of thought experiment.  Few people will attempt genocide or experience a lifetime in jail to find out if it's really as bad as  all that.  In that context, then I see the choice as being between scepticism, relativism, and  objectivism.  IMO, the existence of supermajority experiences of good (life, freedom, truth, peace, love, intelligence) testifies that objectivism is true for fundamental values - and this in turn is weak  evidence that objective ethics may be possible. I don't see that it's any evidence at all. As I point out above, I'm really not interested very much in what the popular opinion is. I'm prepared to trust--to some extent-- the popular opinion about direct matters of physical observation because by and large they accord with my own. However, if everyone else said the dial read 1.5 and it looked like a 3 to me, I would hope that I would believe myself. I.e. believing other people about these matters seems to have a reasonable probability of predicting what I would believe if I observed myself, but the possibility exists that it is not. Since I know from observation that others disagree with me about what is good, I believe I can discount popular opinion about 'good' from the beginning as a predictor of my opinion. I would say that the fact that it seems almost impossible to get people to agree on what is good in a really large number of situations is probably the best evidence that objective morality is bogus, actually.  Firstly, if everyone else said the dial was 1.5 and I saw 3, I'd check my lens prescription.  Secondly, your observation that people disagree shows nothing - people may be looking at different things, by virtue of being in different situations.  If I look at an elephant, I'll  see an elephant.  That doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you  look at an iguana.    Thirdly, I question your assumption that when people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals, that  they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals (that seems to be the  disagreement you refer to).

However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)  Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and here's what he told me:   Here is what is included: TCD-D3 DATman. RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for analog output. Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output). A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The unit is still under factory warrantee. AC adaptor/battery charger. Rechargable battery.  I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute tape it came with (I have some samples on it!).  By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]   I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice. Send him mail and ask him what he wants.  Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy for their recent live album.)  Bryan Davis says:  I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported problem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.   nuff said.  The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are available if you absolutely must have one.  Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs, by the way.)  Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.   John Davison davisonj@ecn.purdue.edu </doc>

Being that both of the first  two games were dominated by Pitt., you would think that they would show a  different game.  This is in addition to the fact that they should show other  games just for the sake of fair exposure.  ESPN must have some very poor marketing people.  They are only concerned with featuring players (i.e. Mario) than featuring good competitive hockey.  Also, some of you should know that (as far as I can tell) ESPN is not going  to show Campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds.  I  believe that they are only going to show Campbell games in the first two  rounds as those series wear on (games 6 & 7, or perhaps games 5, 6, 7).   I've heard that this is because most of their market is East Coast and hence would prefer the Wales stuff.  Also, don't expect Canadian teams on ESPN.  In summary, if you want to see a network that provides good hockey coverage,  watch CBC from Canada.  They may be biased toward Canadian teams, but they don't treat the viewers like idiots, they provide nice updates, and Don Cherry will always provide a few laughs.   </doc>

I want to send aid to Russia.  Many other conservatives do as well.    Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to health for another go around.  Enemy?  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked conservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  OK, I should have said "former" enemy.  I was being sarcastic about what interventionists want to do.  I suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.  Could we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a gun?  Have you considered a non-interventionist policy?  If market reform does happen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to help their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same reason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably consider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help them.  Then their's the ideological point.  We want to "win" Russia over to our type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit over everyone's finances?  It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.  Better to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.  How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something. A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is bound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies (or struggling democracies).)  If a $1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being, couldn't it be raised voluntarilly?  People already give over $100 billion a year to charity.   I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.  Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid. My two "causes" are aid to Russia and a strong space program. Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we only have gridlock on a congressional scale.  It seems instead of gridlock on any scale, we have aid to Russia, expensive space programs, national charity that doesn't help the poor, and probably, studies of drunken goldfish.  I think *limited* government is more key than how democratic it is.  BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who want to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of thing I thought Libertarians were against.  That was an opinion, and libertarians are very big on free speech.  Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue  and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim.  If you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should be VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money would your fellow Russia-aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose weren't using the same government machine to steal money from you and your group for causes you don't support?  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.  People have been saying that for hundreds of years.  Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and global decision making.   All the more reason to depend on the free market which can more efficiently process information, than to depend on rulers for decisions on complex issues.

Date: Thu, 22 Apr 93 20:22:05 EDT Distribution: world Lines: 105  Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

He says, "What's the matter, | can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're      | killing Armenians!"                                      |    DEPOSITION OF ZAVEN ARMENAKOVICH BADASIAN  Born 1942 Employed Sumgait Bulk Yarn Plant  Resident at Building 34, Apartment 33 Microdistrict No. 12 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On February 27 my wife and I went to Baku to go shopping and returned to  Sumgait at around five in the evening. We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, "What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!" I asked, "What's going on?" He says,  What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.  We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.  We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict.  We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.  On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, "We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated." Well he says, "Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now."  I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, "Muslimzade here."  About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, "Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you." They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, "Where should I go?" I  say, "If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left." That's what he did. He went down  there and said, "The Armenians were here," he said, "I let them out the back  door, they went that way." And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.  So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.  In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...  I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them.  There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper.  I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 16:57:20 GMT Lines: 51  From article , by chaneysa@nextnet.csus.edu (Stephen A Chaney):  All the liberals on this newsgroup that think morality should not be legislated, need to stuff it. I'll take morality over the drug plague, the AIDS plague, the kids shooting kids in school, the pedophilers, the explosion in child abuse that is happening now, etcetera etcetera - those things are tangible. All that liberal feel-good b.s. about "We can't legislate morality because.... well.... well just because!" needs to find the fastest route back to its homeland.. RUSSIA and Marxism.  Hmmm...let's see here - the drugs in question are illegal, kids shooting kids (actually people shooting people) is illegal,  sex with children is illegal, child abuse is illegal, etcetera etcetera. Yep, it sure looks like the legislation of your morality is working like a charm.  Uh, people have killed in the name of "God," too, though this century has proven that no "Holy" war can quite match the bloodlust of anti-religious Marxism. Examples: The USSR, 30-40 million (adult, born) people killed (various political purges, etc.); China, xx million killed since Mao Tsu Tung first painted their land Red (and for China, they're still killing); the list goes on. All these countries banned religion and promised their people a Utopia when they were "freed from God." But that still doesn't erase the fact that they took their title of TheWorld'sMostBloodthirsyInstitution out of the hands of none other than the religious faithful, who had held it for 1900 years before that. Hell even Hitler couldn't top what Stalin did in Russia but until recently no one has been willing to discuss that much, so by default Hitler remains the model dictator and villain when in fact Stalin was much his superior in that awful, deplorable sense.)  So religion and totalitarianism seem to be kissin' cousins. I'll pass on both, thank you kindly.   The use of "God" does NOT NECESSARILY MEAN the killing will stop. Please consider that.  The use of "Gawd" seems to encourage killing.     I want the phrase "under God" removed from our pledge also.  God doesn't deserve that insult.  Oh yeah and you better stop using money because "In God We Trust" can be found on the back of the dollar bill....  And you'll stop buying food when the mark of the beast is  required, eh?  terry </doc>

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case, limited" and "big" government are not defined.  I would point out that Lebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with "limited" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western  Europe (where "people would rather live") are often pointed out as  nations with "big government" from a libertarian point of view.    Well, let me help by explaining the difference between a linited government and a failed government.  A limited government has its powers clearly circumscribed,  but is fully capable of enforcing its decisions within those circumscribed areas.  A failed government is incapable of enforcing its decisions except sporadicly.  Two completely different beasts.  Of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government power (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the  interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using  government power for their own ends.  But apart from that little  conundrum...  It would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose that never seems to occur?...   The argument is not between those who want "limited" government and those who want "unlimited" government.  It is between those who believe government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical  grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.   regulation" is such a vauge word...    I wouldn't call it "vague."  I'd call it elastic.  All "regulation" is  not necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some  libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that regulate relatively free markets as identical.

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest periods I've seen Sweden play this year. Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4 just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole.  Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes, Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close range could make it 4-5.

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov. Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score. Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th  goal of the WC. Kariya entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman, then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck. The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.  Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes, and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.  Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts  before this game, pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player among those Kariya with 1+6). Amazing!

On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call for this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any kind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of  difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic,  to say the least.   I assume you mean that analyzing the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation on a case by case basis is worthwhile.  Let me suggest that this is not an option.  Regulators regulate,  it's what they do.  I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  No one suggests that such analysis should be left to "regulators."  In fact, the "re-inventing government" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more about it.    It might be possible to pass an amendment which would prevent any liscensing laws from being valid,  assuming you could convince people that it would overall be a good idea.  Eliminating the liscensing laws which serve no good purpose (the vast majority of them) while maintaining the worthwhile ones (assuming there are any) is not  feasible.  Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only "feasible" approach.  What is not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and  licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent tasks.   I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education,  national defense or local police that suggests a "free market" can provide a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through "statist" approaches.   With some notable exceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile  analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.    jsh  I note that the above examples tend to be among the few government areas  likely to win some approval among libertarians anyway.    Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense. It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)  The most objectionable government expenditures are entitlements,  which also are the biggest.  Certain individuals will suggest that these should be considered defense on the grounds that they are a sort of Danegeld to would-be revolutionaries,  but I personally don't feel we have much to fear from an alliance of geezers and unwed mothers.  Maybe I've led too sheltered a life.  Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries frequently generate support by acting as protectors of "geezers,"  mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds that "we don't have much to fear" from them do so at their own peril.  jsh  Mr. Grinch  Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM    One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy. Average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather......  Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license is required only for the use of public roads.  Abuse by the goverment: This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control would just be abused by the goverment. Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)  We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and usually only two candidates for a given office. A President might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to) and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote for the "lesser of two evils." I don't think this is a matter of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to  create a virtual ban.  Guns 'n Criminals: MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen. Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.  In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws: According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish this.  Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one: What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!  How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting, target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't their only (or even a common) use.  If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem, it's the 'axer' ??  I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different, in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had not done anything wrong.  Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??  A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal  with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course, it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social problems?   If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)  There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes. In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those where guns are less common.  LAST WORD: Responsible gun owners are not a problem, but they will be affected if you want to protect your citicens.  This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some vague "common good."   Frank Crary CU Boulder  </doc>

I'd appreciate some support for this statement.  I'm not sure it really makes sense to me.  I define faith as "belief, in the abscense of evidence". I also include in "evidence" past experiences. Because I have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god. From what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith. It is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word faith") that I find intellectually dishonest.  The ambiguity of religious beliefs, an unwillingness to take Pascal's Wager,   I've heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal's wager?  Pascal's wager goes something like this: Premise #1: Either there is or there isn't a God. Premise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing. Premise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn't matter because death is death, anyway. Conclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.  Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is, Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have heard theists referred to as "99% atheists" because they believe in their god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of this is "what if I pick the wrong god?" Suddenly, the odds don't look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another god's version of hell.  Do I sound "broken" to you?  I don't know.  You point out that your mother's treatment upset you, and see inconsistencies in various religions.  I'm not sure if that constitutes broken-ness or not.   It certainly consititutes  disillusionment.  I don't see how "disillusionment" enters into it. You see, I presented my mother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a questioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mother's version of Christianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had thought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the right one. I'm still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though, it's based on the evidence of past experience) that I'll never find a religion which has all the answers. Sorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs you're going to find. Someone else mentioned that critisism isn't going to make me think any more highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive critisism will turn me off. No accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza.

People were cheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the entire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis Post-Disptach. Enjoy...  By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff:  At 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than Joseph."  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep.  Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.  The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second period of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds, a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history.  The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4, a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.  The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.  Well, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at  every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.  The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game. The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and scorers, who made the most of their opportunities.  Craig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each period. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final  period.  Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling Sweep. Sweep. Sweep." They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour  Bell-Four. Bell-Four." They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye."  Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are on a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.  The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice.  Chicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph backfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.  The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly style is deadly.  Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.  Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up. He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third penalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58, and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan.  The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right shoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour dived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.  The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the Blackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues' bench.  Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues' power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway point of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased the Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.  Try as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped everything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.  Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner's pass.

If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. [...]  Maybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2? By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the  keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300   pairs with identical S1 and S2.

And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ...  Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the  production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each,  plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular,  Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting,  divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the  private sector anyway.

The B's chances for a comeback are now less 1%(That's based on 7-game playoff format)...  Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though! It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie Gibson :-)  Who do you think gets the start in game three?

If I buy a body pannel for $300 after being told that it is genuine BL and discover that it is a non original copy value $50 I get real pissed. If I can get the genuine article I will pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit (probably meaning that its cheaper overall) but it also means that the car is worth a hell of a lot more. Even on a twenty year old car there is a big difference in a baddly restored car where much of the work needs to be redone and a concours classic. I got mine for 600 quid because it was in a shitty state from bad repairs. If it had been well repaired it would be worth a hell of a lot more.  Are you really saying that Ford and GM are having companies beat up for infringing copyright on parts they don't make? I find that very hard to beleive. In the UK they are very sympathetic - Ford recently dug out the Cortina Mk I body press so that some company could make a few more. BL does amazing stuff, they kept the entire assembly line for the MGs and helped set up a company to remanufacture new bodyshells.  There is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off. The former I can't see anyone trying to stop. Most car cos see classic vehicles as a damn good ad for them. The latter though is fraud. If a part is described to me as real GM and money taken under that assurance when they know it ain't GM that's fraud.   It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in everything for them who are _really_ dangerous.  It really is odd.

When your interests are threatened its way too late. You have to challenge the govt when it is attacking someone else's interests.

Date: 19 Apr 93 09:12:07 GMT Lines: 46   My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess. Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.  Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??  Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??  I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.  Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.  Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  The leaves contain either no or less saffrole than the bark.  There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from sassafras products.  I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which is claimed to have the saffrole removed.  I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to commercially produce/sell food with carcinogenic substances, it is not illegal for people to do such to their own food (smoking, etc).  Is this true?  Well, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make  root beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human consumption. Also, when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen bark, she made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human  consumption.

I have yet to chose a tracking  method.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with  pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes away.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional  to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body. This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.  Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their  bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.  The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the Amiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera  trained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events can be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been fun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy. Still, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances, you can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights, and I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments.  I have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic, but I have hopes...  </doc>

Did your style start feeling a bit cramped?  Yes, that's exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was being taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in errors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are "guilty" of their lifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died for me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an impersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well enough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.  I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good thing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message of Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with Christianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I can't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you describe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.  I know how that goes.  Knowing I couldn't and didn't want to  live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me outside, too.    Don't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I don't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder -- not because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't* in my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able, insulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to anyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like that would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.  Till I met the Man, that is.  My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of God with me.  I finally decided that I had once "felt" this presence just as I had "felt" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a little tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.  Since then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in my darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for a moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I have not yet received an answer.  Only when I truly listened to myself, body and soul, did I realize that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being Christian.  There is a higher truth in the universe, and Christianity just ain't it.  Any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be, and why?  Nope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional universe may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional sphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts on this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four- dimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on.  That is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor had anything to do with it.  OK," you may say. "So now, if I'm just being good, am I doing good enough?"  That's for you to answer.  If you feel you're doing fine, then go ahead and ignore us foolish little Christians.  We can present what we've seen and experienced (providing our witness), but it isn't up to us to make that seed sprout.    Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt trips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?"), and so forth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced, but it's not going to be easy.  So much as you don't like what we're "selling", there just may be someone out there that can identify with it.  Methinks you could give us all a  lesson in tolerance and back off.  Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's got these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly intolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say that your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge Christianity from the Christians I know.  I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's self, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that.  So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy, fulfilled life.  I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice things.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and they know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to believe, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who don't agree with them.  Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the Christian's faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we propose otherwise.  Precisely my point.  You've still not given me a reason to be a Christian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem...  The nice thing about religion, if you lose yourself deeply enough in it, is that eventually you'll be able to feel justified in most anything you want to do.  Y'know your right.  Fortunately for everyone around me, I'm not religious.   I'm a Christian.  just as the Moslems aren't religious, and the Buddhists aren't religious.  Who *is* religious, then?

It caught my attention because a talk show guest was criticizing evangelical Christians, saying we believe in absolutes and think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are.  He missed the point.  No, IMO, Mr. Stowell missed the point.  We affirm the absolutes of Scripture, not because we are arrogant moralists, but because we believe in God who is truth, who has revealed His truth in His Word, and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those absolutes."  Mr. Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes. I don't see how that necessarily follows.    Are all truths also absolutes? Is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?  If the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can  explain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths, and which truths are absolutes.  And, who is qualified to make these  determinations?  There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical  Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding  Biblical interpretation.  I find Mr. Stowell's statement terribly simple-minded.  Carol Alvin caralv@auto-trol.com </doc>

Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.  It's truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The Branch Dividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people), but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds for destroying a people.  The government sure gets a lot of mileage out of the word "cult".  Koresh's lawyers is most articulate on this point, I think.  The BATF originally had a search warrant based on information that indicated BD members converted semi-automatic weapons to full-auto.  A search warrant is a right to search, not a right to bring a small army for an Iwo Jima style assault.  Everything the BATF did from the start seemed designed to maximize the reaction they would get from Koresh.  One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday. One can argue about the initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts get lost, that  The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming during the initial raid.  The Branch Davidians opened fire first.  It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians, according to the FBI's statements, opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warning over the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenades did so under fire from the compound.    The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad  Even this seemingly obvious issue is far from settled.  According to Newsweek" (4/5/93), "some federal law-enforcement officials now believe that at least some ATF agents were brought down by friendly fire."  The articles goes on to say how "sources" close to the Justice Department claim that some agents were caught in "heavy crossfire."  Clearly, no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial  shootout, That's why they went in with riot control gas. This would have worked with minimal casualties (The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gas masks) if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind.    precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  That principle applies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers, feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Why was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would also have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than peoples' lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals in our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.  Actually from a tactical standpoint the original raid on the BATF was horribly planned.  Sources in the FBI have been quoted extensively  criticizing the BATF plan.  The BATF raid does make sense, however, if it was timed and planned to garner maximum media exposure for the BATF. which is always in danger of losing funding.  Go in, bust a few cultist heads, wind up on the 6 p.m. news and you don't have to worry about the budget for the next 4 years.  The question is whether yesterday's raid was wired tightly enough. Reno and Sessions both made statements to the press indicating that the experts had not indicated that such a reaction was (possible ?) (likely ?). They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masada-like mass suicide could result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.  Some of these issues are highly technical - the impression I have is that the "Ranch Apocalypse" represented a Rubrik's cube for the counterterrorist types. The Branch Davidians were too well armed for  for a simple assault (the BATF found this out the hard way). The complex was probably to big for the kind of "surgical" Delta Force coup de main that the Bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airliners was highjacked by "Black September". The reason this seige had gone on as long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options, and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.   Similarly, why the raid yesterday?  Reno has a bunch of different answers she's shopping around, none f which make much senOn Nightline tonight, she tried the "we were concerned about child abuse" card, and then it was pointed out that the info. on the child abuse was over two weeks old.  Then she switched to the "It couldn't go on any longer"-style stuff until that kind of played out.  My own theory is that something was supposed to have happened on Easter. Koresh had made some statements building that idea up, and  Easter came and went with nothing happening. It may be that the authorities felt emboldened to move for this reason. IT IS just a theory.   Why yesterday?  Because this was turning into a huge embarassment for the Clinton administration.  I don't believe this is a valid argument. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, but the risks of doing anything to provoke the Davidians were clear enough to warrant caution and to delay action.   It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." He also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it.  However, I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the world had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhaps especially, christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the Branch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.  Maybe David Koresh really was Jesus Christ (sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a new major religion to me).  Ever notice how quickly Christians adopt atheist arguments when it comes to other religious groups...like every other denomination/religion is irrational except their own particular one.  I imagine there are a good many people who are having some problems processing the reality of this affair now.   This matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are not really scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. Here is a case where, if one believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, the predictions of psychological experts were proven false, not under laboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.  Koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire -  we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violently with the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find it difficult to understand why or how this happened. Under such  conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a human reaction, even though that is not a particularly Christian response either.  Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult  members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. Her  grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way to escape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewise real. We may not have seen the end to the self depravation.  The fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent children and not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. It is exceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact. We can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make it better, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn't make it so. There is no meaning to this thing. It just is.

Again, my response is, "so what?"  Is Mr. Rutledge arguing that since the local and federal governments have abandoned their charter to support such activity, and passed laws prohibiting private organizations from  doing so, that they have eliminated the basis for the RKBA?   On the contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.  No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was "a little bit and an anachronism."  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are an anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the  people.  These representatives of the people have already decided that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some cases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional  interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority of the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example of the people using their power of government.  If this is not how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.  Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc. and it would fly using the logic above.  When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times, there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting the hangee.  What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the limitations on the government, probably because they know that the people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just shows how gullible the people have become to "I am from the government and am here to help you sort of line".

Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a  number of times.    No, I simple stated that the people have a right to "join a well organized militia."  And I have also stated that a militia that meets once or twice a year is clearly "well organized."  And this state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a "right" to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated by Hamilton.

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to "spot reduce" body fat other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like "fat", so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the "fat" is "changing" into "muscle", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate, and one does not ever "change into" the other.

The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton  is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia.

EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know  how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?

The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.   By "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities." Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only "crime" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the "Smith phenomenon" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  The rest" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful "heirs" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This Rekhabite" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of "do-it-yourselfers" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine, and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people had nobody to turn to save themselves.  Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a "sect"???  It didn't "splinter" from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.  So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually do - even to the point of suicide.)  What a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am not comfortable with this alleged "cosiness" with Mammon: I assure you that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has appointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about suicide and "atone for sins with blood") is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...   The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.  Make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.  So he hired virtually no one but Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon. I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.  Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship "*how*, *where*, or *what* they may."  If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may as well) that ignorance of the True Way  is an excuse.  You can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are more easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.  A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's "orders" (the late president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX "Peace Keeper" missile maze in Utah).  That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.  None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a man's religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with the weapons suitable for the job, he'll find an ally in me.

However, just in case something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly".   MSDOS configuration:  The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions, you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system up.   Windows configuration:  To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:  VirtualHDIRQ=Off  I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you might want to try adding some more lines:  VirtualHDIRQ=Off SystemROMBreakPoint=false EMMExclude=A000-CFFF  You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).   Windows 3.1 runs slowly:  Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's probably because:  You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a winning solution.  You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to be seen ....  If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808 SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must use Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other solutions.  Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1. What you can do is one of the following:  Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in Smartdrive.  Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supported by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like the 1542) to work with Windows.  After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:  If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:  DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386  Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be obtained from the Adaptec BBS at -945-7727 (hopefully, it's still there).  If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:  DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386  Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.  On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.  I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.  Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.  In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only three ways to get a copy:  You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is around $75.  If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for around $30.  A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1.  Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem.   Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:  There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250:  Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.  Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors. This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542. However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my    Tape backups/restores take a long time:  If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop, start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer than necessary.  The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops, rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops, because data is not fed to it quickly enough.  The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off. The "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can be done in one of two ways:  If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:  DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4  Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4".  If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:  setscsi -n:4  This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the factory defaults.  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.  Do not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4 microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may have to adjust it downwards a little.  Once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores should run faster.  Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by starving memory refresh.  A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while), this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B, although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?   Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:  This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my   Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the tape head:  Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors, resulting in an aborted tape backup.  Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.  The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often. Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds, this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.  Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.  Too many tape read errors.  Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive.  I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is; however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller.   Sound cards:  Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the tape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware.  I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo, recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).  Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this.   Miscellaneous info:  This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm not sure.  Use it at your own risk.  With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB=" parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver. If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a version earlier than 6.00).  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter.  Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.  To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information):  You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers, you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains everything that you need.  You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS, you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.  This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410 kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin boards.  To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand information):  Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.  The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but requires, ASPI4DOS.  I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:  SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS. SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers. SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:  SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI drivers).  Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet, a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:  PD1: ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10 ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might have it, if any forum does.  As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B. However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of BSD Unix).  In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:  FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10,256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGH,UMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:  FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10,256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGH,UMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked like:  FILES=40 BUFFERS=40 BREAK=ON STACKS=10,256 DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF DOS=HIGH,UMB DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE shell = c:\dos\command.com /p  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version doesn't.    Local Variables: fill-column:	72 eval:		(auto-fill-mode nil) End: </doc>

Date: Mon, 26 Apr 1993 07:45:00 GMT Lines: 56  Just thought I would add $0.02 to DeskJet thread. I got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago.  I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for past 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I got software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister and father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's). The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.  My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it to him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief advantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:  Advantages:	Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's printing), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't, so look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet AppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one DW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to color or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I received many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those ImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night....)  Disadvantages.	Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and wasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and running (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your bookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but I don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of about 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after fooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine. Other disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in speed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press software solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but they won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.  In the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even when soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board Transparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser Postscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB negatives directly onto a transparency.  Well, hope my babbling has helped. squish@endor.harvard.edu  </doc>

I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!). The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only problem is that it is quite slow.  I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest. I would like to get information about : the refresh rates the various cards provide; quality of windows drivers; standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff).  Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip  info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it,  let me know. If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration: Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard) monitor DARIUS 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768)  can reach 70kHz horizontally)    I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent  enough to record settings.

I believe floppy controller also uses DMA, and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to do directly with SCSI.  No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits, IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has    nothing to do with SCSI.  Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands.  The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE.  And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.  Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive.  The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the  devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback.    Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?

Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring.  The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions," the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units."  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace," he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire," the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population," Tass quoted him as saying.  At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh," he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.  Randy  </doc>

Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:  A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah, Ka stands for K automatic"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.  My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps, even the real sneaky ones.  When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.  So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.   eliot </doc>

Her neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound headaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  She stopped taking all analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15).  The weekend was pretty bad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours. Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on Friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick.  Skin was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsided in an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to control the pain.  Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A friend of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused heart attacks in several people.  Apparently the mild chest pains were common in these other people prior to there attacks.  Is this just rumor?  Has anyone else heard of these symptoms?

Andrew Byler) Subject: Monophysites and Mike Walker Date: 6 May 93 04:34:59 GMT Lines: 45  Mike Walker   If you are using the standard formula of fully God and fully human, that I'm not sure why you object to saying that Jesus was human.  I think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity.  It's a consequence of the fall.  Jesus is human, but not a fallen human.  --clh]  The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism.  This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.  Andy Byler  These issues get mighty subtle.  When you see people saying different things it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things, or whether they are using different terminology.  I don't think there's any question that there is a problem with Nestorius, and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical.  But I'd like to be a bit wary about the Copts, Armenians, etc.  Recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought.  Nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought.  More moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox, e.g. Theodore of Mopsuestia.  My impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition, not just Nestorius' version, and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox.  --clh] </doc>

Distribution: world X-Mailer: cppnews $Revision: 1.20 $ Lines: 53 Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 19:48:00 +0000  Here is a different viewpoint.  FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: "Do you want one copy or lots of copies?", "One",  Inkjet".  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement cycles.  Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility. there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)  TC.

If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth, and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.  You are making a ludicrous suggestion.  Ludicrous, huh?    HEAVILY ARMED RELIGIOUS CULT BATTLES GOVERNMENT  Troops have been called out after a skirmish involving government officials and a religious cult which has been gathering weapons in their private city".  The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which they believe to me imminent.  Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region.  Troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is said to be strictly administered.  Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these "Mormons" are to be exterminated, or driven from the state..    And that's the news account, from 150 years ago..  We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of their rights to worship and bear arms.  Now we don't.  Does that include the right to murder little children?    Since the jury's not yet in on exactly how the fire REALLY started, the only dead children here for whom blame can be proven at the moment were  the ones shot by government fire.  How about killing ATF officers?   A citizen has the right to stop ANY attacking criminal -- even one with  a uniform.  Clothing aside, you know, it's still not legal to serve a search warrant with a concussion grenade.  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but  Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under  right to bear arms."  Well then, find out.  By the way, this is not a claim of "Koresh's folks," it is a claim of  the government -- the same government which DID have grenades and grenade launchers and DID use them.  No one has seen ANY evidence of the BD's  having, much less using, such weaponry.  If they were stocking such things  against Armageddon, why would they have left them in the boxes when  Armageddon actually arrived?  Of course, to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record.  It has happened before.  Please explain.  I do not remember Jews or Mormons (as a group) overtly  breaking a judicious (a.k.a. non-Nazi) law and being punished for it.  See above, for one example.  The "abuses" involved were non-mainstream  religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  Sound familiar?  In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to society as the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)  By the way, I find your statement about "non-Nazi" law ironic.  Koresh was  suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON the text of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  ("Gun Control's Nazi  Connection;" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S.  Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207,  769-0760.)  By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?  FAILURE TO PAY A TAX. That's right -- the BATF are TREASURY agents.  Did a failure to pay a gun tax really justify armed attack, night torture, and ultimately the death penalty?  I'll bet all you cult haters are happy now, right?  Just hope you're not next.

As for day 51, as long as the FBI and BATF didn't INTENTIONALLY set the fire then, while it is certainly tragic, the majority of Americans (according to a recent poll) have no problems with the operation itself.   Who gives a good goddamn about some bullshit "opinion poll" of "most  Americans?"  Most Americans swallow the government line that they're fed -- not because they're stupid, but because it's the only line they ever hear.  Most Americans" thought the staff at the McMaster school was guilty, guilty, guilty.  Woops, turns out they weren't.  "Most Americans" once thought that black slaves weren't human beings.  Woops, wrong again. Most Americans" thought Saddam Hussein was the Antichrist.  Oh dear, he was a "special friend of the American government" until two years  previously.  You know, maybe truth ISN'T determined by majority vote of a half-informed public after all.  In fact, most Americans (according to this poll) think it should have been resolved sooner...

IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all  of baseball.  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot  pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least  appear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot  excede three runs.  I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in  determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the  ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in  the next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no  way.  I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his  teammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth  and left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in  the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  The  third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat"  satisfaction.  Mike  I bleed the blue of Dodgers and even like Lasorda spaghetti sauce.  </doc>

I know one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong you'll fry a board and i  don't want to do .  if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.  btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of little boxes). Oh, well . . .  one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus--- you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible. it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.  omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution so others can, too. thanx for the input.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during  the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited,  assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people  because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts  of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes,  set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts  behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly  attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population  indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent  Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with  axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below.  Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions  of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and  Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from  behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of  Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed  widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from  Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide  by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian,  Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French  journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.  The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum,  Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their  villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities.  Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and  cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by  Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish  and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents.  Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of  the victims of these cruelties can be heard.   Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are  speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as  well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is  proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war."

Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know what you mean.    As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters tend to look at.

Sec 552, which was intended to prevent "secret lawmaking" by administrative bodies. These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States. It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens. It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property. It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law. The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille- gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations.  Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S REPORT of the SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION of the COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION FEBRUARY, 1982 Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE O WASHINGTON : 1982   Letter to Constituent: April 1993   Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms , which is the Federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.  It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government. The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons.  The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.  As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians.  Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion.  Sincerely,  Dennis DeConcini Chairman Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government  April 7, 1993   Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com </doc>

Anyone who supports the legality of abortion but objects to it being covered by a universal health care program (that covers nearly everything else, as well) is contradicting themselves.    Actually, I believe anyone that supports the legality of abortion but supports it being covered by a universal health care program is contradicting themselves.  I am pro-choice, but I am also anti-government- funding-for-abortion.  Why?    Example:  if a pro-lifer writes on the net that abortion should be illegal, he/she is immediately flamed with "you have no right to impose your morals on everyone.  If you don't support abortion, don't have one; but don't take the choice away from everyone."  By supporting government funding I feel I would be saying "If you don't support abortions, tough, because you are  paying for them anyway".  To me this no longer makes it a mutually exclusive choice issue (which invalidates a main argument of many pro-choicers); I would be forcing my morals on pro-lifers.  In this respect I feel the  hypocrisy of supporting government funding and being pro-'choice' greatly  outweighs any hypocrisy of not supporting government funding and being  pro-choice.  Ok, one last time.  (yeah right)  In order for *you* to "not pay for any abortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay for any abortions" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women who have reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it on their own, are just "out of luck".  Their *choice* is blocked because of econonmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortion in the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for any abortions".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that the governemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it, which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion. This involves *more money*.  Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women who desire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not want an abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they can not afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will be able to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How then are you "paying for" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is "paid for" by the cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all because we remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure. Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often used as an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for just because it is desired and can not be afforded.)  If you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to have an abortion when they can't afford it, I will complain about "paying for" the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it. Why should you pay for someone else's choice?  Why should I pay more to restrict* someone's choice?  a bunch of other stuff deleted - not related to me :) )  A pro-choice majority would not be enough for one of the two pro-choice candidates to win, however a pro-life majority *should* have been enough for the only pro-life candidate to win.  I think the fact that he didn't says something about the number of "pro-life" people in the country.  No, it says something about abortion not being the most important issue to many pro-lifers (as well as everyone else).  I personally think it is  stupid to vote for someone because of their stance on *one* issue :) .     A pro-lifer who does not consider abortion an *extreemly* important issue is an oxymoron.  If it's not important enough for you to vote the way you feel because of "other issues", then why should anyone take your insistance that "abortion is wrong" seriously?  People's perception of the economy and Bush's apparent indifference (coupled with a liberal media) were more likely explanations.    It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*, unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  In order to be unbiased there would have to be allowance made for "shades of grey", rather than lump all of the middle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll I heard about.  Of course, then we would know once and for all how the country really* feels about it, and then what could we argue about?  other stuff deleted- left for Ralph to answer :) )  Ralph D.

Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series.  His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out" I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a  veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.  I don't buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try this exercise:  XXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3 in the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth, he gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now with XXX's team still on top.  I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be "he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win."  If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be "he is an inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch.  Needs more seasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack."

The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a "full page" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.  Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen How much you would be willing to pay for it Any helpful commentaries on the idea  Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful, but who knows!), please send me some.  Thanks in advance!!!  Mike </doc>

Opinions expressed are mine and do not represent those of Rockwell.    Obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by anything from murder to sleeping late.  That doesn't mean that the same people would accept those substitutions.  The question is whether the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to represent Christ's relationship to humanity.  This is at least partly* an empirical question.    In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because over time they always seem to lead to trouble.  I think that's the case with slavery.  One can argue that in theory, if you follow Paul's guidelines, it's possible to have Christian slaveholders.  But in practice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and not abuse it.    The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality.  (Note: Christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some extremist agenda).  You may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at least relevant.  You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't look at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such association.  If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at it too.  Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such examinations would necessarily come out the same way.  Part of why there aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that some of them do produce obviously bad results.  clh] </doc>

There are two approaches:  If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go from the monitor to the back of the computer.  You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the computer.  Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at good prices).

My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include: have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.) reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....) don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!) find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.) Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.    The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a compromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.  Joe Fisher </doc>

Why can't it be the same way now?"   insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little relevance to what I've found]  OK.  The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  "I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it." (John 14:12-14) So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time, the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that "there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time." (1 Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, "there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus being our mediator rather than any other man.  Joe Fisher  The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right" may not be as obvious as you think.  In what sense to you mean didn't have? Christian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sense that they were saved by his death.  God is not bound by our chronology.  So in some real spiritual sense they did "have Jesus". Even in terms of knowledge, while they surely didn't have the explicit knowledge that we have, Christians have normally seen messianic prophecy as knowledge of Jesus, even if knowledge from afar. clh] </doc>

Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4  In short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons ever in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle, Mays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the writers of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one had the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball supports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.      Phil Brown                | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |  </doc>

It's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents decides they'd rather stop offering the service.  I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government, then the contract for providing escrow service would include some termination clause like returning the keys.  The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured.  This makes the funding separate from government.  But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?   If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.  If the user is the buyer, what's the service?   Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service! Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!  If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying? The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine - I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key!  Face it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want. The only people who want it are the government, not the users. What you're really talking about is either the government paying for the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes, or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)  I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from your serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency.  Here in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that sort of services for user fees.  There are people willing to keep your store from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective. If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, there are people who will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee. Something could scratch the paint, after all. And what a shame if your Clipper key got out!

If you're interested in a change, here's an idea.  If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? What right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality? Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your "brother" and say that I was  exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your "morality" ?  Yes, and then you can suffer the consequences in our collective decision to incarcerate you for that act. Morality is not a necessity for a functional collection of peoples, just a set of acceptable behaviours (is this the same thing?).  There is no universal moral standard as there are many different situations in which collections of social organisms find themselves. Some species of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of male bees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony. The bees die of course, but it was for the good of the colony as a whole, so was it immoral?   Our society (at least our western one) is one of abundance when it comes to the basics; food, water and shelter.  Therefore our moral standards are based upon those circumstances.  Unfortunately we enforce our moral standards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations, because we believe in some "universal morality".  What I am saying is that, yes, you CAN still murder my sibling, but don't expect your peers to be impressed by it in our society. However in some other circumstances, it may actually be a "moral" thing to do (in which case it wouldn't be called murder, probably sacrifice). After the act, you could say what you liked, but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society will condone your act, so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself, including how you will feel about it (remember your feelings have been socially imbued).

I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)

Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered a minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series.  Well, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually, they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I think Borque, Neely, Jouneau , and Company are gonna be swinging a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not gonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey.  Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his shot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting it up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming, They score, THEY SCORE!!!".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping up and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating over to Brad May who he jumped on.  Doug McKee mckee@cs.buffalo.edu </doc>

I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.   I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since.  The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed. autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance) Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or using a numerical method.  anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:  Cd = d/(q*2R)  where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder. To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that the car would need to overcome.    Bp </doc>

Davis, Near East Research Inc.,   pp. 108-109]  Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin on April 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance. Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs had blockaded, and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars. Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens in Jerusalem.  Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin, but that attack does not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to paint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about In 1983, however, Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain) interviewed a survivor, Mophammed Sammour, who testified that 116 out of a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after the massacre,' Sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the five clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a list of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through the names.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure was wrong.'  Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians, the killing of civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated. The attackers left open an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left unharmed. After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired on the Jewish troops, some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and civilians indiscriminately. Independent observers told _The Guardian_ that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women." </doc>

Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage, the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to "defend the faith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.  Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine, and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people had nobody to turn to save themselves.  Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually do - even to the point of suicide.)  The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.  So he hired virtually no one but Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon. I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.  If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may as well) that ignorance of the True Way  is an excuse.  You can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are more easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.  That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.  None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a man's religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with the weapons suitable for the job, he'll find an ally in me.      </doc>

I'm not sure about this but I hope the answer is that you can't apply under the law of return.  By conversion, you've elected not to be a part of the Jewish nation.   Which was my point. By converting to another religion I do not loose my cultural identity, I just loose my religious identification.

At the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world that *you* do not consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation.  So, why should the Jewish Nation consider you to be a member?  To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not by my religion. Actually, if I am an atheist, which is in fact like  converting into a non-Jewish in terms of religion, I am still considered as part of the Jewish Nation.

Or, even more, I can be proud of my Jewish culture while still be convinced that the real god is another one.

Now, how do you explain the attack on Syria in 1967, Syria didnot enter the war with israel till the 4th day .  By the way it is funny that you are implying that the reason behind 1967 by israel was only to capture Sinai, egypt !    to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank.

One application is soldering to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches. If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver off of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated solution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be disolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.  Peter Reilley ..... pvr@wiis.wang.com .....

<doc id="20_newsgroups/comp.graphics/39489" url="" title="20_newsgroups/comp.graphics/39489"> From: abig@netcom.com (Access Bus Industry Gp) Subject: ACCESS.bus (Re: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest) Date: Tue, 11 May 1993 23:39:36 GMT Lines: 92  Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's  Contest Announcement)  WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?  ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer  peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that  uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to  a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or  keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR  gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and  others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications  such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality,  Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more  can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts  Plug and Play on every PC.  The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of  systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host  computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a  number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software  development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device.  ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:   ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone  to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without  fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single  host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus  data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.  ACCESS.bus Physical Layer  ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware  protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level  handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock  synchronization.    ACCESS.bus Software Protocols  The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three  levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.  I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines  arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C  provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with  different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing,  framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the  receiver.    BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between  a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the  ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an  ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with  additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot  plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus  addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot  plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the  system is running, without rebooting.  APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus  protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular  types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application  Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified:  keyboards, locators, and text devices.  ACCESS.bus support on the PC  All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the  PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the  base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.   An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1  controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with  the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for  multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and  Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples  of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

Certainly, a Trinitron would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.  Conclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not perfect.

Somebody correct (flame) me please!   You miss the point.  A lot more negotiation is needed to convince women to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with  their sex.  Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather than be known as a slag, slut or whore.  With men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck  constantly.  And with gay men, where both partners can prove status through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation where there is a lot of sex.  The difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men.

One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent. ..  Please get it right, Jon. This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes, because the NFs of this world are fouling the once-pristine NT intellectual nest with their verbal poop.)  The dominant correlation is NT  Phlegmatic (and _not_ NT  Choleric). One of the semantic roots of "choleric" is the idea of "hot" (emotional) and one of the semantic roots of "phlegmatic" is "cold" (unemotional).

As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he should abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.  Agreed. Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf. The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class. Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.  If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY) and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia), we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending, but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the  infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)  In addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being  required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships. The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down a pork happy Congress.  A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the  most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.

Dealing Coke -- Death Dealing Heroin -- Death Dealing Pot -- Death Dealing Crack -- Death  The list goes on and on!!!......  JUST KIDDING!!!

Sounds good so far  from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out  the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)  However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be  bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a  recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD. The 60 Minute Report said it worked with "cocaine" cigarettes, pot and heroin.  Ryan </doc>

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi  party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of  the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  s.  Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records, anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered tainted evidence.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know  what tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  s and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.  The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd, the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better place when they departed,   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from  their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.  but concrete particulars are still no more than more or less shrewd guesses.   Diccon Frankborn  Given that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered "shrewd guesses"?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.  In article  lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes: Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also  widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity.  In the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house.    One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:  I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....  He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not. ...  Back to Lee Lady:  These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."  These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A "carefully designed and controlled study" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a "carefully designed and controlled study" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as "support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.)    Russell </doc>

I'm not expert on Christianity, but I know a little about history and how the repeated instances of Messianic figures (jesus was neither the first, last nor most serious of those pretenders) related to the history of the period.  A messiah in those days was to bring salvation from the Romans! He was supposed to reclaim Israel and Judaea, bring the Israelites back from what is now Iraq-Persia-Afghanistan, and do so not only by faith, but by real war.  Any Messianic pretender would tell his followers to get ready for war, since they were going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free the Israelites.  For those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far more seriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was only rejected after his defeat, although for a short time he looked as though he would win.  They even got to mint coins before the Romans triumphed.  Now how that has played into Christianity is rather interesting given your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koresh figure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel? Had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants of the Israelites?

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies, we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10 times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as dramatically.  When standards of living, population densities, and industrial structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group of Seven nations.  Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product, even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the overall U.S. economy.  Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per of GNP than are centrally planned economies.  Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not reduce demand.  Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance, gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state at the expense of the individual.  Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion" is no. in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.    Available from: Cato Institute Second Street SE Washington, DC  20003         The Cato Institute  Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the traditional American principles of limited government, individual liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in  questions of policy and the proper role of government. The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation of the American Revolution. Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for civil liberties. To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal. In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations, corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from the sale of publications.

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.  There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.

However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.  Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I don't see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke "Q" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth.  We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).  The version of the "usual theory" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and "Q".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.  As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.  This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.  Unfortunately, I haven't got the info at hand.  It was (I think) in the late s or early '80s, and it was possibly as old as CE 200.  When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?  Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.  And I don't think a "one step removed" source is that bad.  If Luke and Mark and Matthew learned their stories directly from diciples, then I really cannot believe in the sort of "big transformation from Jesus to gospel" that some people posit.  In news reports, one generally gets no better information than this.  And if John IS a diciple, then there's nothing more to be said.  That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.  I'm not really impressed with the "theology" argument.  But I'm really pointing this out as an "if".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.  The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.  In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.  But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it's agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.  C.

But apart from that little  conundrum...   This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good solution.  One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it. The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains government (particularly state and local), even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).  Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now, but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of, if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.

RKBA archive: general information and anonymous ftp instructions.  The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command "type binary" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:  ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login: Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:  ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:  Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:  l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:  Remote system is UNIX. Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:  ftp>   If you do not get the line "Using binary mode to transfer files." Run the command:  type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are  usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:  cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:  cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:  ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command "get" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:  get INDEX or get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:  Transfer complete. bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:  cd congress/103rd get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:  quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:   File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine   Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:  put file_name  In this case:  put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a "Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.

MTA (mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu) wrote: I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would recommend you to take a look at  your dictionary alt.atheism FAQ files  to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_. I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without paying careful attention to this issue.   First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give  succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of  you typing for hours, I'm sure.  IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the replies might keep you amused for hours.  Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system" although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs but are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  required to get the precise idea across.    No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life, the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could hardly be called a philosophical system.  Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities.  Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on.  Some comments on your questions:  What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your "conversion" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert' anyone?  Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?    This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_  cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be  beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.  Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))  To what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your  beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as an explanatory method?    This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.  Sigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net, anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?

Gealow) Subject: Standard Colormaps Date: 27 Apr 1993 13:48:56 GMT Lines: 49 Distribution: world  I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps.  The X11R5 documentation says: "Usually, a window manager creates  these colormaps."  I wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.  According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):  For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and  base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.   To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:  gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF  XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is  used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the  call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is  specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the  total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%  of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number. Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation  to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,  defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,  and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,  one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.  When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1,  XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs  a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives  the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would  expect red_max to give the maximum gray value. </doc>

How much can you tell about a person's health by looking into their eyes?   Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).  You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the Classic Example, but there are probably others.  Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.  The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:  How does it work?  What evidence is there?  The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures. Always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.)  The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.  The word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means "(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist".

Kinsman  Precambrian Electronics Falstaff Rd. Rochester, NY 14609 thomask@kodak.com Copyright March 15, 1991    ABSTRACT  The format of images created for use by  MS  Windows  3.0/3.1 applications  is	documented  in	the MS Windows Programmer's Reference guide.	This guide is intended as a  clearify  some wording	of   the   specifications,   and  to  put  forth  a recommendation among the various alternatives.  Please send updates/corrections/suggestions and revisions	 to me.   Please  thank  me  for  writing  this on my own time by keeping my name  with  the  document.   Thank  you  for  your respect.  This document Copyright, 1991, by Thomas B. Kinsman. If  desired,  a  PostScript  version  of	this  document	 is available.  This information is free.	 You get more than what you pay for. Don't sue me if I'm wrong.   OVERVIEW  The DIB image file format is intended to be a "Device Independent  Bitmap" file  format.  (What Microsoft means by "Device Independent" is unclear to me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit pixels.  These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems. If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte- swap all short and long integer values.  By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP".   This  is  because    March 15, 1991         they  are  a  super-set of earlier "bitmap image files".  Consequently you will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files.  Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors"  of  DIB images: o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment. o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager. o   Old-style Bitmap images.                                         March 15, 1991         DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS  The DOS DIB images consist of: A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file	 as  a DIB  file.

An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists, this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows RGBQUAD structure. The image data itself.   The OS/2 DIB images consist of: The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the image file, and the offset to the image data. A "BITMAPCOREHEADER"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image attributes. An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows RGBTRIPLE structure. The image data itself.   The Old Style image bitmap consists of: Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value. An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header was a BITMAPCOREHEADER). The image data itself.   CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.  Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps. The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  "windows.h"	include	 file. Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit images.  The five general steps are: Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER structures the basic image information. If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the color palette of RGBQUADS. Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in    March 15, 1991         the "bfSize" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER. Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the file,   and   putting  this  in  the  "bfOffBits"	field  of  the BITMAPFILEHEADER. Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER, the color palette, and the image data (in that order).  The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type- defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with MicroSoft C.    Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.|  typedef |	 meaning		   |  BYTE    |	 unsigned character	   | WORD    |	 two byte unsigned integer | DWORD   |	 four byte unsigned integer|                                  March 15, 1991         THE BITMAPFILEHEADER  This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { WORD	 bfType; DWORD	 bfSize; WORD	 bfReserved1; WORD	 bfReserved2; DWORD	 bfOffBits; BITMAPFILEHEADER;  The "bfType" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.  The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in later.  Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2"  fields  are  always  set  to zero.  The "bfOffBits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written write after the color palette if one exists.                   March 15, 1991         THE BITMAPINFOHEADER  This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{ DWORD	 biSize; DWORD	 biWidth; DWORD	 biHeight; WORD	 biPlanes; WORD	 biBitCount; DWORD	 biCompression; DWORD	 biSizeImage; DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter; DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter; DWORD	 biClrUsed; DWORD	 biClrImportant; BITMAPINFOHEADER;  The "biSize" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a BITMAPCOREHEADER.  The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels.  The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines.  The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out as if there was one color plane.  The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.  The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding. However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the data is not compressed.  All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.  The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed". For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  "biClrUsed" colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set this field to zero.    March 15, 1991         COLOR PALETTES  Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as: typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { BYTE	 rgbBlue; BYTE	 rgbGreen; BYTE	 rgbRed; BYTE	 rgbReserved; RGBQUAD; The "rgbReserved" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  "rgbBlue",  "rgbGreen",  or rgbRed"   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color composition.    IMAGE DATA  There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and certainly was.  Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The number of bytes per line can be calculated as:  bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;  or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---  bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;   When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first. The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file.  For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel. However, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the order  blue,  green, red.  While most image file formats write data out in    March 15, 1991         an "RGB" ordering, a DIB image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 "BGR" ordering.  SUMMARY  This  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  DIB	 images	  from applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines.	If you find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on	to  me so that I can modify this document accordingly.                                           March 15, 1991    Thomas B.

Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are  every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of  disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.

Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:  MHz 68040 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower than Q 950 style machines for sure). Ethertalk card on-board Audio in/out MB RAM on motherboard SIMM slots NuBus slots. More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.  In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you audio or ethernet  or the same video options. With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I think it ends up costing more.  Greg Dudek  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21" with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an accelerator.  Paul </doc>

Since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution in this country, if you keep your mouth shut, how can they prove that you didn't forget your pass phrase.   Well, I'm no lawyer, but I'll supply some ancedotal evidence which may change your mind.  ** Note ** I do not agree AT ALL with what went on in this case, and neither will most of you.  THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT  THAT IT *DID* HAPPEN.  Right here in America even.....  About three or four years ago, there was a rather nasty custody case in or around Washington D.C.  The upshot was, an ex-husband was suing for  visitation rights, which were granted.  The woman believed that the man had been sexually molesting her children.  (much like Allen/Farrow, but not as famous).  Anyhows, she spirits away the kids and refuses to tell the court where they are, and denies him visitation rights.  She "keeps her mouth shut", and what happens?  She SITS IN JAIL for almost a year, on CONTEMPT OF COURT, until the legislature passes a special law limiting the time a person can be held.  If they hadn't passed the law, she'd most likely still be there.  The kids were in New Zealand, I belive.  Now (story finished, commetary starting)....  IMHO, the only reason the legislature moved was because there was an outpouring of public sympathy for this woman...  most people believed she was right, and were outraged. Not likely to happen for Joe Random Drug Dealer, Child Molester or perfectly innocent privacy lover, who might have something to hide.  Innocent until proven guilty doesn't mean you get to walk out of court humming a happy tune because the FBI can't read your disk.  Just ask those held for contempt, those who can't make bail, etc, etc.  Again.... I disagree totally with the concept of holding someone based on suspicion, but people who keep thinking that it won't happen are bound to get a rude shock when it does......   Also not a lawyer, etc. but if I remember correctly the Contempt of Court business is used in order to compel cooperation with what is (perhaps questionably, different issue) the legitimate business of that court. Quite literally the party is found guilty of holding the court "in contempt". Now, the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if certain threatening conditions are met. Once the key is gone there is no question of Contempt of Court as there is nothing to compell, the key is no longer there to be produced.  Obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes however extenuated) I think that this charge would be a hard nut to make.

I will upload this package to SIMTEL20 later.  You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use if no fee is gained. There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any damage caused by this program.  Important changes since Version 1.35: Added support for IRIS. Support Mix/Concat. two images. Added support for 'batch conversion'. Added support for 'load/save palette table'. Added support for 'edge enhance'. Added support for 'crop one line'. Added support for 'negate image'. New color quantization option. Fix some minor bugs.  Introduction: This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....) on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different formts. Include simple file management system. Support 'slide show'. Support 'batch conversion'. There is NO LIMIT on image size. Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver. If you want to modify video driver, please read section .   Hardware Requirement: PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher. min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work). I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance). Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.  Supported Wares:  Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI) Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768  XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX  Unsupported:  DPMI Microsoft Windows  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory model, SVGA graphics.   Installation: Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP. If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd) This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible with original version) But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem, DON'T put go32.exe within search path.  Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387  Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn. Other drivers are not tested. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display. You don't need to use vesa driver. If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display, please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither, and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.   Detail:  Initialization: Set default display type to highest display type. Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).  When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)". d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files. pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use for reading current file. pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This program will automatically determine which format this file is. The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check standard extension. Still fail, report error. pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'. If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key except ESCAPE). If any error occurs, program will make a beep. w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue. ESCAPE to terminate. pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type. pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting. pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.  Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu. You can do special effect on image. pressing RETURN: show image. in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text mode. pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image. pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits. pressing SPACE: save current image to file. B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit). Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits). Full Color: save as color image(8 bits). True Color: save as 24-bit image.  This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change directory to what you want. Then,  pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename. pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename filename under bar).   This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory, the performance is poor.  If you want to save 8 bits image : try GIF then TIFF then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...  If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless): try TIFF or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster No one is better for true 24bits image)  I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.  Not all subroutines are fully tested  This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION, COMMENT about this program, Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13). I need your suggestion to improve this program.

What I am looking for is a stable ultra-long solid state timer. What they want to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount of snow fall over a period of six weeks. Every two weeks, they want to trip a selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the snow. Then by digging down into the snow, the snow fall amount can be measured as they come to the different color pellets.  The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold (-40 degrees) and a power source that wouldn't drain. I have looked at the XR-2204 timers and the standard NE556 dual timers, but thier temp specs won't go that low. Also, two weeks equates to 1,209,600 seconds per firing, which means one big timing cap ! I have found 2.2 farad (yes, Farad !) caps that have a working voltage of volts and are small in size.   Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.  PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the  programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

There is no difference whether the  output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to  this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision  copy protection.)  In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry  of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow  magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The  circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.  It is a pretty lame scare tactic.  (I've seen something similar on a BBS.

The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7, then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip, thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.  Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!.

Bennett"  Subject: Ideas on Clipper Date: Thu, 22 Apr 1993 14:51:57 -0400 Lines: 92   I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret, and some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from   THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised, April 21, 1993      The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook  mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:  the Skipjack encryption algorithm F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change) U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip      ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:  E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and  E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.    suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field  E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some "panel of experts" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.  So, am I wrong? Or are these problems.  jon  </doc>

I've tried it with some success before, but it won't work on a Charlie Manson dog or one that's really, *really* stupid.  A large Irish Setter taught me this in *my* yard (apparently HIS territory) one day.  I'm sure he was playing  a game with me.  The game was probably "Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor" Before  He Can Dispense the TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  What, a dog weighs 150lb maybe, at max? You can't handle it?  We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational constant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping, no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also,  recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth  operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger. The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place  as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended  lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).  You have, I presume, thumbs? Grapple with it and tear it's head off!  My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable  instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard. There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon of dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement and confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally  looking back at me.    Seven at One Blow!" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs of my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.  What I had interpreted as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt.  Sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human, we have *all* the advantages.

It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen, and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.  Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.   RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):  Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13" monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).  Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer" for these items.

The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. "The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters," he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.  SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to "reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are," to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag "Bureau." The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

Please, can you tell us why those quotes are "crap"?..because you do not  like them!!!...because they really exist...why?  As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source  given by Serdar Argic ..   You couldn't reject it...   In addition, the Author's Preface was written on January 15, 1923, BUT THE BOOK was published in 1924.  Here we go again.. In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give  the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively! Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of pages, please ask by sct)    I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.      DD] I can provide .gif postings if required to verify my claim!  VD] what is new?  I will post a .gif file, but I am not going go through the effort to show there  is some Turkish modified re-publication of the book, like last time!   I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication) and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..  Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)  First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You called Serdar Argic a liar!.. I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote... I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)  And now, you are lying again and talking about "modified,re-published book" without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..).. by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty  well suited theories', as usual)  And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use, which are:   R 198  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215     It is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has   Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying "it is not possible..." ..If not, what is your point?  Differences in the number of pages? Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934.. No need to use the same book size and the same letter  charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!  The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published..  And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given  by Serdar Argic exist!!  It was the issue, wasn't-it?    you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?   You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a "crap".. People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still has so many "craps" in the 1993.   Any question?

Do you believe that they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes? Not. They just extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth.  And to add further fuel to the flame war, I read about 20 years ago that the "natural" MSG - extracted from the sources you mention above - does not cause the reported aftereffects; it's only that nasty "artificial" MSG - extracted from coal tar or whatever - that causes Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.
